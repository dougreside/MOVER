SCENE I--	A quiet valley at the foot of
the Hartz Mountains ;   Cottage of Dame Barbara,
R. H.  3rd Ent., with practicable upper window 
and balcony ; Set tree beside cottages, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
low rustic stone bridge or long  tail
piece, with platform from R to L backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs,
above which light clouds appear, 
illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon. 
MUSIC. At rise of curtain--enter 
Rodolphe at back R. H., he descends, comes 
forward and after looking cautiously 
around claps his hands three times beneath 
the window and conceals himself in the arbor.  The upper window opens 
and Amina appears on balcony.

Surely I heard his well-known signal.

Tis I, Rodolphe.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
Rodolphe!  Hush, speak low, if my foster-mother still sleeps, I will join you. <div class="inner_stage">[Retires.]</div>  
</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="">
[Music.]  Rodolphe goes up stage and 
looks cautiously off, then comes down.
Amina enters from cottage.

[Throwing herself into his arms;)</div><div class="p">Rodolphe!</div></div> 
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
My own!
</div></div>

<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
When did you return?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
'Twas past midnight:  although wearied and 
footsore I could not sleep until I had seen 
you.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
Oh, how wearily the days and nights have 
passed since you left me!  What kept you 
so long?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
Ill fortune, Amina.  After reaching Gottingen,
and finding no purchaser for my picture, 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel, only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
And your beautiful picture, upon which 
so much of our future was built, you 
have brought it back.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
No; crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union, I 
left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am, without a single guilder in my pocket, and what is worse, if I fail to redeem 
my pledge at the end of two months it 
is lost to me forever.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">[Aside]</div> Poor, dear, Rodolphe, he knows not 
the worst, the heaviest blow is yet to come, how shall I break it to him; <div class="inner_stage">[aloud,]</div> Dear 
Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you 
made me forget for a moment that which 
I fear to tell you.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="">
(The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon 
grow ruddy with the rising sun.)</div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
Fear to tell me!  Speak, what has happened?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
Be calm and Listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir, upon raising my eyes, after we 
had finished the anthem, I found a 
dark, strange man gazing upon me;  
a moment after he quitted the spot. 
I inquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
Well.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am,</div><div class="p">
Although I met his gaze but for a moment, 
I felt that it boded evil to me--to <em> us</em>.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rodolphe</div><div class="p">
Evil!  Evil to <em> us</em>?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Amina</div><div class="p">
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears 
idle; the next day brought him here to 
our humble abode. He told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">[Starting.]</div> Loved! you!--</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Amina</div><div class="p">
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in 
obscurity, that we should be removed to the 
castle, that masters should be provided for 
my suitable education, and in a year 
I should take the place of the late Countess 
of Wolfenstein.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
And Dame Barbara----</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
Joyfully consented.  This very day is set 
apart for our removal.  The escort will 
be here at sunrise.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
And <em>you</em>, Amina, <em>you</em>!---</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">
I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you 
know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rodolphe</div><div class="p"><div class="inner_stage">
[Vehemently]</div> By Heaven, you shall not go.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Amina</div><div class="p">
Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="">
[Dame Barbara appears on the balcony.</div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
I say you shall not!  Were he twenty 
times more potent I would oppose his 
power to the last.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Bar.</div><div class="p">
Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till 
I get down! <div class="inner_stage">(Music. She disappears 
from Balcony and enters from door.]</div>
What, jade, ingrate!  how dare you!  
Is this your gratitude!  Where is your 
pride!  You the most noble Countess 
of Wolfenstein that <em>is</em> to be meeting 
young men in secret and on the very 
day of your bethrothal!  Oh, if his high
mightiness the Count should find it out!</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Am.</div><div class="p">

But mother --</div></div>

<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Bar.</div><div class="p">
Not a word, how dare you; in with you, 
into the house, in I say! <div class="inner_stage">[Forces her into the 
cottage, closes the door, then turns to 
Rodolphe]</div> So, beggar, you've come back,
have you!  How dare you show your 
unlucky face here at such a time as 
this!  I had hoped you had fallen into 
the hands of the conscript officers and
gone for a soldier, or better still, been 
carried off by the Demons of the Brocken.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
 And yet,as you see, I've escaped both.  
Hark ye, Dame, I love Amina, she 
loves me, you, yourself promised that 
she should be mine as soon as I could 
command a hundred silver crowns.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">
Bar.
</div><div class="p">
 Bah, that was before I knew her value, but 
now that I <em> do</em> know it and others know it 
too, I've changed my mind.  But where 
are the hundred crowns ; where's the fortune you were to get for your great 
painting?  I warrant me you hav'nt got a 
single groschen of it.  Come, let me see the 
hundred crowns</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
My picture is not yet sold.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Bar.</div><div class="p">
Ha, ha!  Did I not say so!  Not yet sold!  Here is a pretty fellow that would 
take a young girl from her comfortable
home, a good bed, sweet milk and 
egg pudding, to lodge her on peas straw, 
and feed her at best on black bread and 
sour cheese.  Oh, was there ever such villainy?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Rod.</div><div class="p">
Nay, but listen to me.
</div></div>

<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">
Bar.</div><div class="p">
Not a word, begone! Do you think people of 
quality have nothing to do but listen to 
beggars complaints and above all at such 
a time as this.  Begone, I say, this is 
to be a festival day, the maidens of the 
village will be here anon, the grand escort 
will be here headed by the Count's chamberlain,  
aye, and his lordship the Count 
himself will be here to bear the Countess 
that <em>is</em> to be and her right honorable 
foster-mother that <em>is</em> to be to the castle.

already, out of the way I say.</div></div>

villagers, with garlands, followed by males, 
two of whom bear a rustic chair, festooned

 Ah, you are early friends.</div></div>

<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Car.</div><div class="p">

</div></div>
<div class="sp" id=""><div class="speaker" id="">Car.</div><div class="p">
Bliss me, how grand Dame Barbara has 
grown to be sure.  If she goes on at this 
rate the wide halls of the grand old
castle of Wolfenstein will be a world 
too small to hold her.  I hope this 
piece of good fortune will not make 
such a fool of dear 'Mina

its hole in the oak, answers to the croak of the dreary 
monk-raven ; and just now I saw a big fat buck scampering through 
the forest with his tail on fire.  Oh dear! Oh dear! what 
fearful omens!  And I'm to be married to-morrow.  If anything
