<head>Act 1st</head>
<stage>
SCENE I--	A quiet valley at the foot of
the Hartz Mountains ;   Cottage of Dame Barbara,
R. H.  3rd Ent., with practicable upper window 
and balcony ; Set tree beside cottages, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
<milestone xml:id="v_s_1" type="variant-start"/>low rustic stone bridge or long <milestone xml:id="v_s_2" type="variant-start"/> tail
piece, with platform from R to L backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs,
above which light clouds appear, 
illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon. 
MUSIC. At rise of curtain--enter 
Rodolphe at back R. H., he descends, comes 
forward and after looking cautiously 
around claps his hands three times beneath 
the window<milestone xml:id="v_s_3" type="variant-start"/> and conceals himself in the arbor.  The upper window opens 
and Amina appears on balcony.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker>
<p>
Surely I heard his well-known signal.  
Hist! who&#39;s there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<milestone xml:id="v_s_4" type="variant-start"/><stage>[appearing,]</stage><p>
Tis I, Rodolphe.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Rodolphe!  Hush, speak low, if my foster-mother still sleeps, I will join you. <stage>[Retires.]</stage>  
</p></sp>
<stage>
[Music.]  Rodolphe goes up stage and 
looks cautiously off, then comes down.
Amina enters from cottage.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Am.</speaker>
<stage>
[Throwing herself into his arms;)</stage><p>Rodolphe!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
My own!
</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
When did you return?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
&#39;Twas past midnight:  although wearied and 
footsore I could not sleep until I had seen 
you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Oh, how wearily the days and nights have 
passed since you left me!  What kept you 
so long?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Ill fortune, Amina.  After reaching Gottingen,
and finding no purchaser for my picture, 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel, only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
And your beautiful picture, upon which 
so much of our future was built, you 
have brought it back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
No; crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union, I 
left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am, without a single guilder in my pocket, and what is worse, if I fail to redeem 
my pledge at the end of two months it 
is lost to me forever.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Aside]</stage> Poor, dear, Rodolphe, he knows not 
the worst, the heaviest blow is yet to come, how shall I break it to him; <stage>[aloud,]</stage> Dear 
Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you 
made me forget for a moment that which 
I fear to tell you.</p></sp>
<stage>
(The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon 
grow ruddy with the rising sun.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Fear to tell me!  Speak, what has happened?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Be calm and Listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir, upon raising my eyes, after we 
had finished the anthem, I found a 
dark, strange man gazing upon me;  
a moment after he quitted the spot. 
I inquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am,</speaker><p>
Although I met his gaze but for a moment, 
I felt that it boded evil to me--to <emph rend="underline"> us</emph>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Evil!  Evil to <emph rend="underline"> us</emph>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears 
idle; the next day brought him here to 
our humble abode. He told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Starting.]</stage> Loved! you!--</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in 
obscurity, that we should be removed to the 
castle, that masters should be provided for 
my suitable education, and in a year 
I should take the place of the late Countess 
of Wolfenstein.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
And Dame Barbara----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Joyfully consented.  This very day is set 
apart for our removal.  The escort will 
be here at sunrise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
And <emph>you</emph>, Amina, <emph>you</emph>!---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you 
know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p><stage>
[Vehemently]</stage> By Heaven, you shall not go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Dame Barbara appears on the balcony.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
I say you shall not!  Were he twenty 
times more potent I would oppose his 
power to the last.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till 
I get down! <stage>(Music. She disappears 
from Balcony and enters from door.]</stage>
What, jade, ingrate!  how dare you!  
Is this your gratitude!  Where is your 
pride!  <milestone xml:id="v_s_5" type="variant-start"/>You the most noble Countess 
of Wolfenstein that <emph>is</emph> to be meeting 
young men in secret and on the very 
day of your bethrothal!  Oh, if his high
mightiness the Count should find it out!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>

But mother --</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Not a word, how dare you; in with you, 
into the house, <milestone xml:id="v_s_6" type="variant-start"/>in I say! <stage>[Forces her into the 
cottage, closes the door, then turns to 
Rodolphe]</stage> So, beggar, you&#39;ve come back,
have you!  How dare you show your 
unlucky face here at such a time as 
this!  I had hoped you had fallen into 
the hands of the conscript officers and
gone for a soldier, or better still, been 
carried off by the Demons of the Brocken.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
 And yet,<milestone xml:id="v_s_7" type="variant-start"/>as you see, I&#39;ve escaped both.  
Hark ye, Dame, I love Amina, she 
loves me, you, yourself promised that 
she should be mine as soon as I could 
command a hundred silver crowns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Bar.
</speaker><p>
 <milestone xml:id="v_s_8" type="variant-start"/>Bah, that was before I knew her value, but 
now that I <emph rend="underline"> do</emph> know it and others know it 
too, I&#39;ve changed my mind.  But where 
are the hundred crowns ; where&#39;s the fortune you were to get for your great 
painting?  I warrant me you hav&#39;nt got a 
single groschen of it.  Come, let me see the 
hundred crowns</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
My picture is not yet sold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Ha, ha!  <milestone xml:id="v_s_9" type="variant-start"/>Did I not say so!  Not yet sold<milestone xml:id="v_s_10" type="variant-start"/>!  Here is a pretty fellow that would 
take a young girl from her comfortable
home, a good bed, sweet milk and 
egg pudding, to lodge her on peas straw, 
and feed her at best on black bread and 
sour cheese.  Oh, was there ever such villainy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Nay, but listen to me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Bar.</speaker><p>
Not a word, begone! Do you think people of 
quality have nothing to do but listen to 
beggars complaints and above all at such 
a time as this.  Begone, I say, this is 
to be a festival day, the maidens of the 
village will be here anon, the grand escort 
will be here headed by the Count&#39;s chamberlain,  
aye, and his lordship the Count 
himself will be here to bear the Countess 
that <emph>is</emph> to be and her right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph>is</emph> to be to the castle.
<stage>[Music.]</stage> Hark, here come the villagers 
already, out of the way I say.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Pushes him rudely aside, goes up and 
looks off, R.H. Rodolphe retires into 
the arbor.</stage>
<stage>
[Enter lively, from R.H. at back female 
villagers, with garlands, followed by males, 
two of whom bear a rustic chair, festooned 
with flowers, <milestone xml:id="v_s_11" type="variant-start"/>they cross the bridge and come 
forward, greeting the Dame, females L.H. 
males R. at back.  The sun appears 
above one of the spurs<milestone xml:id="v_s_12" type="variant-start"/>.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<milestone xml:id="v_s_13" type="variant-start"/> Ah, you are early friends.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Yes, but not earlier than the sun, for see, 
it is already peeping over the great toe 
of the Brocken.  But where&#39;s Amina?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>
Barbara
</speaker><p>
<stage>[Drawing herself up.]</stage>
 The Countess that <emph>is</emph> to 
be is preparing to receive his lordship the 
Count, but never mind her ladyship. 
<milestone xml:id="v_s_14" type="variant-start"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Bliss me, how grand Dame Barbara has 
grown to be sure.  If she goes on at this 
rate the wide halls of the grand old
castle of Wolfenstein will be a world 
too small to hold her.  I hope this 
piece of good fortune will not make 
such a fool of dear &#39;Mina
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Ros.
</speaker><p>
I don&#39;t understand this. I thought &#39;Mina 
was bethrothed to the handsome young 
painter Rodolphe,  whatever could 
have become of him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Oh, &#39;tis said he has gone for a soldier. 
But come, while &#39;Mina is making 
ready let us rehearse our Festival Dance.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Music: Grand Garland Dance 
by principals and full Ballet, during 
which the Males gather around the table 
and eat and drink.  After dance, Barbara
re-enters extravagantly dressed, wearing a 
monstrous cap, ridiculously trimmed)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
There!  Having completed her ladyships 
toilet I have attended to my own, and 
if I know anything about dress I flatter 
myself that my appearance would do 
honor to any occasion. <stage> [Displays herself.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<stage>[Aside to Rosetta.</stage><p>Mercy on us, was there 
ever such a fright!  Why she looks for 
all the world like a great horned owl, 
dressed up in the cast-off finery of 
a peacock.  Ha, ha, ha!  did you ever! 
Observe me tickle the old buzzard.
<stage>[Aloud and with affected admiration.]</stage>
Why, Dame Barbara! is that you!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Drawing herself up.]</stage>Of course it is, child;  
Who else <emph>should</emph> it be! <stage>[Aside.]</stage> I knew 
I should make them open their eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Why, you&#39;ve almost taken away my 
breath!  I declare Dame, you&#39;re looking 
gorgeous; so young and girlish, too,  indeed, 
if I were &#39;Mina--I beg pardon, 
I mean her ladyship, I wouldn&#39;t 
care to have <milestone xml:id="v_s_15" type="variant-start"/>her in the way when 
his lordship the Count arrives.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
And why not pray!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
 Because I should consider you a 
dangerous rival.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Nonesense, girl, you don&#39;t think so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Indeed, Dame Barbara, I was never more 
serious in my life. <stage>[Laughingly confers 
with Rosetta and villagers.]</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<milestone xml:id="v_s_16" type="variant-start"/>It is strange I never noticed it before, but 
that girl <milestone xml:id="v_s_17" type="variant-start"/>Caroline is a very sensible person.
<stage>[Music.]</stage> Ah, here comes the escort!
</p><stage>
[All go up and look off R.H.--Rodolphe glides 
from the arbor into the cottage unobserved.</stage></sp>

<stage>
	[Enter from R.H. <milestone xml:id="v_s_18" type="variant-start"/>and crossing the bridge, 
Von Puffengruntz, bearing <milestone xml:id="v_s_19" type="variant-start"/>his wand of office, 
<milestone xml:id="v_s_20" type="variant-start"/>preceded by two servants of the 
Count&#39;s household, as he comes down the 
Male Villagers take off their caps, and the 
females curtsey</stage>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>

<stage>(L.H.) [With pompous <milestone xml:id="v_s_19" type="variant-start"/>consideration.]</stage> Be 
covered, good people, be covered, the air of 
the valley is yet damp, we never insist 
upon ceremony at the expense of health.
<stage>[Aside.]</stage> Ahem! It is the true policy of 
greatness to occasionally waive a point 
of etiquette <milestone xml:id="v_s_20" type="variant-start"/>on dealing with inferiors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
What a courtly gentleman!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
What an imposing female!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Curtseying.]</stage> Your Excellency is welcome.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Puf.</speaker> <stage>[Bowing.]</stage><p> I cannot be mistaken. I was just 
about to inquire, but that stately presence 
and graceful dignity tell me that I am 
addressing Madam Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir. <stage>[aside.]</stage> How one&#39;s 
manner will betray one. I always said I 
belonged to a higher sphere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
I come, Madam, by the Count&#39;s order, to announce 
that the cavalcade has arrived and is now 
resting on the plateau beyond the ravine.
His lordship will be here presently, and in 
person conduct your fair foster-daughter
to her palfrey, that waits without, impatient 
for the honor to be mounted by her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage><p> Oh, sir, his lordship is so considerate.  
But, may I inquire if I have 
been thought of?  Am <emph>I</emph>, also to be provided 
with a becoming escort?  Is there any palfrey 
without impatient for the honor to be ridden 
by <emph>me.</emph></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
That shall be my privilege
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Astonished.]</stage> Eh!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
That is, I have charged <emph>myself</emph> with the 
especial <milestone xml:id="v_s_21" type="variant-start"/>happiness of being <emph>your</emph> escort.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Curtseying very low.</stage> Oh! <stage>[Music.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
He comes!  Room there for his lordship! </p><stage>
[Villagers range themselves to receive 
the Count who enters R.H. <milestone xml:id="v_s_22" type="variant-start"/>crosses the bridge, preceded by 
guards and followed by Wulfgar and 
Bruno.  When down <milestone xml:id="v_s_23" type="variant-start"/>L.H. Villagers shout

<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p>Salutation to the good Dame Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Curtseying very low. </stage> Oh, your lordship.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p>And how fares your lovely charge?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Well, may it please your lordship, quite 
well, a little nervous from over anxiety to 
see your lordship, but that is quite natural 
with us, poor silly things ; I suffered 
<emph rend="underline"> dreadfully</emph> in that way when my poor 
dear, dead and gone Christopher courted me,  
many and many a time---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p><stage><milestone xml:id="v_s_24" type="variant-start"/>[Interrupting her.]</stage> But the fair Amina.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Is quite ready and dying to see you. I will present her to 
your lordship at once.</p><stage>[She is going into the cottage when 
Rodolphe appears and comes forward, leading 
Amina by the hand. Chord.</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Allow me, Dame Barbara, to do the honors.</p></sp>

</speaker><p>
Rodolphe! <stage>[Picture of astonishment.]</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
My lord, Count Wolfenstein, permit <emph>me</emph>, 
Rodolphe Werner, a poor artist, to present 
to you Amina, foster-daughter to Dame 
Barbara--a free maiden of the valley and 
my affianced bride.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p>
Who is this madman?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
N-n-n-n-nobody your lordship, that is
a poor, weak simpleton, who imagines he 
is betrothed to every girl in the village--  
as your lordship <emph>truly</emph> says, a madman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
A madman!  mercy on us, we shall all 
be murdered!  Seize him, secure him, somebody, 
everybody.</p></sp>
	<stage>[Music.  Wulfgar and 
Bruno seize Rodolphe, and after a struggle 
overpower him.  Amina screams <milestone xml:id="v_s_26" type="variant-start"/>and throws herself at 
the Count's feet, he raises and passes her 
to Barbara, then turns to guards.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p>
Release him. <stage>[They release him.]</stage> His misfortune 
claims our pity.  Let some of his fellows conduct 
him hence, and see that no harm come 
to him. </p></sp>

you indeed mad to brave the tiger in his 
lair. <stage>[Leads him R.H.]</stage> Come, I say, this is

Can this be death?  Death!  No, no.  I cannot, I will not

[Music forte.  He drags himself toward the casket, seizes 
it, rises with difficulty and totters to the altar, at

<stage>[Wild blast and same action as before, in addition to

showing in luminous forks in backing.  Huge serpents 
writhe to and fro across the stage.  Zamiel, bearing a 
sceptre, around which is twined a green serpent, suddenly 
appears from trunk of blasted tree, with strong light 
from red medium thrown upon him.  He holds the picture a 
moment before speaking.  Hertzog kneeling down, L.H. Music ceases. 
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Zam,</speaker><p>Arise.
<stage>[Hertzog arises.]</stage>
Why am <emph>I</emph> summoned?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
My life is waining.  Give me to live ; feed the dull currents 
of my sluggish veins ; give me fresh charms and potencies.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>
Wherefore?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Men hate, and, did they not fear, would despise me.  I would 
repay their hate with hate ; I would live on, on, on, and in that 
life rival thy dread power of evil.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>
What wilt thou give for such a boon?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Whate&#39;er thou wilt. Give me but life, and all I have is thine.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis not enough ; what&#39;s thine is mine already.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
What else?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>
Listen.  A soul--younger, fresher, whiter than thine--must 
on each recurring year, be, by thy arts, turned to my account.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
I hear, dread master, and will pay the price.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>For every soul thus lost to good and gained to me, a year&#39;s
new life is thine.  A single soul, a single year ; a hundred 
souls, a hundred years.  &#39;Tis with thyself to live forever!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Forever?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Zam.</speaker><p>
Forever.  But should the stroke of midnight fall a twelvemonth
hence and no lost soul by you betrayed within that 
time come wailing at my gates, perdition closes on your dark 
career.  Is&#39;t a compact?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>It is.</p></sp>

&#39;Tis well.  Listen, slave.  Within a dungeon of the eastern

him.</p></sp>

ACT 2</head>
<stage>
Scene 1.--A subterranean vault beneath the castle of Wolfenstein. (in 2.) 
Set floor R.H.N.E.  moveable panel in upper part of 
R.H. flat ; sliding stone panel in lower part of 
L.H. flat.  Wulfgar discovered chaining Rodolphe 
to wall of R.H. flat.  Music at rise of curtain.  
Lights half down.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Wul.</speaker><p>There, my fine fellow.  I think you&#39;re both safe and comfortable.  
No intrusion, neither light nor sound, ever come 
here.  This should have been your lodging last night, but you see I mislaid the key.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Wretch.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wul.</speaker><p>When you want exercise or change of air,
 and you can manage to get out of yonder little encumbrances 
<stage>[pointing to chains]</stage>,
 you can take it in the vault beneath your feet.  Yonder trap leads 
to it.  You may find it a little mouldy, and may stumble 
over the skeleton of the last lodger.  But that&#39;s nothing ;  
any change is better than no change at all. 
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Monster, begone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker><stage>(Taking up lamp)</stage><p>
Oh certainly--anything to oblige.  In the meantime, if your 
exercise should give you an appetite, and you should want 
food and water, cry out for it--cry loud and it wont come.  Ha, ha ha!  
Good night.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Exits R.H. door.  Lights down.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Alone!  So ends in darkness and in death all my bright dreams 
of the future. And must I perish thus--I, who have but entered 
the portal of life?  No, no, it cannot be!  I must, I will 
burst these bonds.
<stage>[Music.  He makes an effort to break the chains.]</stage>
&#39;Tis vain, they defy even the strength of despair.
<stage>[Shuddering.]</stage>
How awful is the chill of this noxious vault ; its icy vapors 
press upon my brow like the clammy hand of death, and freeze my very 
marrow.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Music.  Hertzog enters with dark lantern through 
sliding panel in L.H. flat.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Thy friend.

Who are you?

<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker>
<stage>[Turning the light of the lantern upon his own face.]</stage>
<p>Behold!</p>
<stage>
[Chord
</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Starting.]</stage>
Hertzog, the Crook!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Aye, so men call me.
<stage>[Puts down lantern off L.H.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Ill-omened bird, what brings you here?  Yet why should I ask?
You come the minister of Death.  &#39;Tis well, &#39;tis merciful--
begin your work.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Out, foolish boy.  I serve no human master.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Then why are you here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>I come to give thee liberty.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Liberty?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Aye.  Listen.  I hate thine enemy.  Thou lov&#39;st a maid of whom 
Thou lov&#39;st a maid of whom thou hast been robbed. Would&#39;st win her back?  I have the 
power to aid thee.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Begone, tempter.  I know your power, and can guess from whence it 
comes.  Men say you deal in dark and necromantic spells 
that warp the senses and enthral the soul.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Bah!  Art thou, too, tainted with the vulgar fear that calls 
philosophy--the natural working of great nature&#39;s laws--a spell 
of darkness?  It is the light, weak boy, the light, which we 
sage men, who waste our lives oe&#39;r midnight lamps glean from 
dull vapors for sluggards&#39; use.  Fools sneer the most 
when least they understand, and brand as foul what nature stamps 
as fair.  Thy gains gall thee ; let me loose them.
<stage>[He touches them with his staff; they fall to the ground.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>[Surprised.]</stage>
What is your purpose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Again I say, to serve thee.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Listen, I will tell thee a secret.  She whom thou lovest is 
of noble birth.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Amina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Aye, yet not Amina, but the only child and heiress of the 
noble house of Wellenstein--stolen when but an infant by a 
revengeful Gipsy whom her father scourged, and given to gabbling 
Barbara.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Amina noble?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Aye, and thou of humble birth.  But gold can buy nobility ;
nay more, can give thee power to cross thine enemy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Why talk to me of gold?--to me, the poorest of the poor, whose 
purse contains not half so much as one poor silver mark.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Thou&#39;rt poor indeed, but thou art poor because thou wilt be 
poor.  &#39;Tis with thyself to shame the wealth of mighty Croesus.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>Hast thou not heard of glittering gold in massive piles fast 
locked within these mountains?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
An idle tale ; a senseless fable told by croning gossips ; 
A treasure often sought, but never found ; and some do say &#39;tis
death to seek it. 
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>I tell thee, boy, the story&#39;s true, this gold is palpable to 
sight and touch, and may be garnered, too, if thou art bold 
enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
I&#39;ll hear no more!  Thou&#39;dst take advantage of my desperate 
strait to work some juggle to entrap my soul.  Begone, I say, 
begone!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>And leave thee to thy doom?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Aye.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>And thy affianced bride--would&#39;st thou so like a craven 
yield her up unto thine enemy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Oh, agony!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>&#39;Tis true she loves thee ; but bethink thee, boy, she is but 
woman, and she may be won.  Her noble birth is known to Wolfenstein, 
who means to wed her, and with her fortune prop his 
falling house.  Already, flattered by his serpent tounge, she 
dries her tears and listens to his suit.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis false!
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis true!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
The proof?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Behold!
</p>
<stage>
[Music.  He waves his staff; a panel 
slides in upper part of R.H. 
flat slides open, showing through gauze Wolfenstein and 
Amina, the former clasping the hand and 
kneeling at the 
feet of the latter whose face is half averted.  Picture strongly
lighted)

<sp><speaker>Rod,</speaker><p><stage>
[Starting toward it.]</stage>
By Heaven, he shall not!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
<stage>
[Interposing; waves his staff; panel closes.]</stage>
Bravely said, bravely said.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p><stage>
(Turning quickly)</stage>
What dev&#39;lish compact would you have me sign?  Propose it 
while my reason whirls and desperation aids your dam&#39;d design. 
If by the act I snatch her from his grasp, I&#39;ll pay the ransom 
though it reach my soul.<stage>
[Hertzog, with face averted, chuckles sardonically)</stage>
Come, philosopher or fiend, whate&#39;er thou art; the price, I 
say, the price. 
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Pah!  I ask no compact.  I would serve thee gratis.  I but 
demand that thou shalt serve thyself.  Be rich and thou&#39;lt be 
powerful.  In thy revenge upon thine enemy and mine, thou&#39;lt
pay thy debt to me with interest.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker><p> 
Where lies this wondrous treasure?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Listen.  Amid the fastnesses of the Hartz, beyond the outlet 
of the Black Gorge, lies a small lake whose waters few have 
ever gazen upon, for vulgar fear and superstitious dread have 
long since marked it for enchanted ground.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
I&#39;ve heard the story.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Trace carefully its northern shore until a rock rising like 
a wall bars further passage. Beneath a fringe of tangled vines 
you&#39;ll find a boat concealed.  Behold this talismanic ring!
<stage>
[Takes a large ring from his finger.]
</stage>
&#39;Tis a magnet of wondrous power.  When thou hast found the 
boat step boldly in, this ring will guide thee safely to the 
entrance of the goldern cavern, within the compass of whose 
glittering walls thy wondering eyes may feast on wealth far 
greater than the coffers of the world can boast.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod,</speaker><p>
Give me the ring.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis thine.
<stage> [gives it.]</stage>
Stay, thou&#39;lt need a henchman,
<stage> [stamps his foot.]</stage>
Varlet, come forth.
<stage> [Panel in L.H. flat slides as before and Greppo enters. [aside.]</stage>
He too shall perish.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Your will, Master?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
To part with three.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
Oh, if this should be true.
<stage>[aloud]</stage>
With me!
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
With thee, knave.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Wherefore?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
I weary with thine appetite.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p><stage>
[Aside.]</stage>
Here&#39;s a chance!  Oh, here a chance, if he but stick to it.
I must seem unwilling lest he repent,
<stage>[Aloud]</stage>
Dear master, I will reform, believe me, I will reform, allowance 
me to what would starve a mouse, nay, more, to pleasure 
you I will not eat at all.  I&#39;ll live on air, but do not cast 
me off.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
I am resolved.  Behold thy future master.
<stage>[to Rodolphe.]</stage>
Thou&#39;lt find him faithful but he breeds a famine.  Take for 
thy present need this purse of gold.
<stage>[offers purse; Rodolphe by a gesture refuses it.]</stage>
May, when thou art rich thou can&#39;st repay it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p><stage>
[Taking purse.]</stage>
Nay, more, if what you say be true, eternal gratitude--
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
Bah, you trifle time.
<stage>[Waves his staff, panel opens.]</stage>
yonder lies your path, it is a glorious one, begone!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Farewell.  Come, boy, come.
<stage> [Music. Exit at panel. Greppo following turns to 
entreat Hertzog, who raises his staff threateningly; 
Greppo exits hurriedly at panel.</stage>
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
<stage>
[Standing in opening and chuckling gazes at them.]</stage>
The thought of vegeance stirs within his heart, the lust of 
gold is rising in his soul, the path that leads to where &#39;tis 
hoarded ends in death.  He&#39;s mine!  Ha, ha, he&#39;s mine!]

<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me, girl, remember your station and consider 
mine.  Who am I and what am I that I should be lodged in a 
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker><p>
Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself, it was out of consideration for 
your ladyships eyes--any little flurry does so spoil the 
natural beauty of their expression.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Carline, you&#39;re a good girl, you&#39;re a considerate girl, and I 
forgive you; but eyes or no eyes. I&#39;ll not be imposed on.

Here he comes down the great stairway, as full of flesh and 
scant of breath as ever.

and as the waddling old porpoise appears to have a liquorish 
tooth for this silly old buzzard, I&#39;ll leave them to bill and 
coo, while I run off to comfort dear &#39;Mina who has passed the

<stage>
[Von Puff. enters L.H., Carline courteseys and exits L.H.]
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Eh! what!  madam Barbara, stirring so early?  Why, bless my 
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets 
of the castle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Then let it hang, and be hanged to it!  Stirring, indeed!  Havn&#39;t 
I been stirring all night? Hasn&#39;t her ladyship been stirring 
all night, and wouldn&#39;t the Seven Sleepers have 
been stirring all night, too, if they had lodged where I did?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Surely nothing has had the audacity to disturb the quiet of 
your slumbers?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Nothing! To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night nothing?  Why, the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster-mother that <emph>is</emph> 
to be, to her right honorable ladyship that <emph>is</emph> to be, passing 
the night in apartments overlooking a dog-kennel.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
A dog-kennel!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night with 
raw meat by their one-eyed keeper, on purpose to give them the night-mare 
and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes were ever known to have been unruly.  I promise you that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I, too, am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they commanded the best view of the mountain.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
But I don&#39;t want to look at the mountain.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the north windows last night during the
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Belzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubileee there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough! If the mountain is 
unpleasant, it shall be removed.  No, no, I--I mean <emph>you</emph> shall 
be removed.
<stage>[Approaching her in a wheedling manner.]</stage>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
A strange, weird place, and one, it seems, not often trod by human

<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Master Greppo!  Master Greppo!  He calls be master Greppo!

What think I, princely master?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>Aye.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Why, since you honor me with consultation, and give me leave to 
think at all--a privilege grown rusty from great lack of use--
I say we&#39;re right, and that the lake we seek is near at hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Why think you so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Because just now I heard a bittern cry, and twice ere that I

Scene IV.--The Grotto of Golden Stalactites.  A grand and 
comprehensive water-cavern of gold, deeply perspective, 
with stalacti-form arched roof.  Cut 
wings representing vistas running parallel 
and harmonizing with that of the main grotto, 
the mouth of which [5 feet high and 5 feet wide] 
discloses an open lake or bath and distant shore at 
back.  Set transparent silver waters, in which 
are seen sporting fishes and nondescript amphibea. 
Diminutive fairies asleep in the waters 
of the grotto in golden shells.  Set ground or 
shore piece richly studded with gold and jewels.  
Set masses of emerald and gold R. L. and C. upon 
and at the foot of which are reclining gnomes 
and amphibea.  Fairies asleep in poses R. and L.
The moon--seen through opening at back and 
over the distant shore of the lake--shows red 
 at the opening of scene.  [Music at change. Shortly 
after which, Dragonfin, who has been asleep 
on a jewelled mass on the shore (C.), slowly awakens, 
rises, and stretches himself.  Upon turning 
he sees the red upon the face of the moon.  Music chord.]

<p>Awake! awake!</p>
<stage>
[Music. Hurry. Gnomes and amphibea spring to their 
feet. Fairies and water-nymphs enter hurriedly R. &amp; L.
Diminutive sprites in the shell awaken.]</stage><p>
Behold! there&#39;s blood upon the face of the moon!  Our Queen&#39;s
in danger! To arms! to arms!</p></sp>
<stage>
[Music. Hu<supplied>r</supplied>ry.  The sprites in the shells disappear 
R &amp; L.  The gnomes, amphibea and fairies rush off R. and L. 
and immediately reappear, armed--the two first named with 
knotted clubs and tridents, the fairies with javelins.  
During the action the red disappears from the face of 
the moon, and it assumes its natural color.]</stage>

[All kneel.] [Music. Stalacta rises rises (C.) from the water, slowly,
and steps on shore, assisted by Dragonfin.]
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Arise, my loving subjects.</p>
<stage>
[All rise]
</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Drag.</speaker><p>Mistress, but now the light in yon great sapphire died out,  
and stains of blood flushed in the face of the pale moon.  
You have &#39;scaped some deadly peril.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Thou art right.  Listen, all.  To-night, while wandering in the 
fastnesses of the Hartz, without my protecting talisman, I 
heedlessly trod within one of the charmed circles of our 
enemy, the arch-fiend Zamiel.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
Omnes</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>On the instant I was transformed into a white dove, with 
shorn pinions.  From beneath the rank leaves of an adder-plant
glided a huge serpent.  Its eyes were burning coals,
its tongue a living flame.  I was paralyzed with fear and 
powerless to move.  Nearer and nearer it came.  I felt its 
stifling breath displace the purer air.  I saw its venomed 
fangs glistening in the pale moonlight.  Rising from out 
its deadly coil, it poised itself to strike, when suddenly a youth, a 
mortal, strangely present in that wild, wierd spot, seeing the 
danger of the trembling bird, seized a dead bough, which 
chance had fashioned like a holy cross, and smote the foul 
thing dead, then bore me safely from the charmed spot and 
gave me life and liberty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Drag.</speaker><p>Revenge! Revenge on the minions of Zamiel.
<stage>[Goes quickly off R.H.U.E.]</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>
Omnes</speaker>
<p>Revenge! Revenge!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Nay, let no thought other than of joy mingle with this happy 
time.  Remember, &#39;tis my natal hour, and I would have it, as 
in the past, a festal one.  Let the invisible Harmonies of 
this, our realm, breathe sweetest concord only; and you, bright 
Crystaline, with your fair sisters, chase with flying feet 
the silver hours.</p>

[Seats herself on bank, C.] 
</stage></sp>
<stage>[Music.  The fairies form for 
dance.  After the first pose, a loud, prolonged warning note, 
as if from a shell, is heard outside. at back.  
All start in alarm, and hold the attitude of listening.  
The sound is repeated.  Music.  Hurry.  The 
pose is broken, and the fa<supplied>i</supplied>ries, gnomes and amphibea, 
seizing their arms, form in alarm on either 
side.  Dragonfin appears quickly through trap behind 
1st set water and lands in front of ground piece.]</stage>

<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker> 
<stage>[Who at the first sound has sprung to her feet.]</stage>
<p>
Speak, what danger threatens?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Drag.</speaker><p>
The sentinel shells, played upon by the watchful winds, give 
alarm!  Two daring mortals, armed with the enchanted magnet 
of the Black Crook, approach the secret entrance.  Already 
they have passed the white whirlpool in safety.  They come 
to despoil our realm of its glittering wealth.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>Fear not the talisman they bear is powerless against the 
spells that guard the portal.  Is my battalia at its post?

	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stal.</speaker>
		<p> My faithful subjects, your Queen commends the zeal with which you would guard from
			mortal sight our beauteous realm ; but ere these rash intruders perish I would
			gratify a strange desire. Speed hence, good Dragonfin, catch me their shadows
			from the bosom of the moon-lighted lake, and cast them upon my faithful mirror. I

Dragonfin, come hither.  Fly with swiftest speed to the rocks 
beneath the waters of the guarded entramce.  When the frail 
bark which now approaches shall be rent asunder by the relentless 
spells that guard our realm, be it your task to 
snatch from death these daring mortals and bear them safely 
hither. </p></sp>

[Music.  Hurry.  Dragonfin bows low, springs into
the water and disappears.  MUSIC.  A small boat with 
two mechanical figures, representing Rodolphe &amp; 
Greppo as they appeared in the mirror, appears from 
R. H. outside, at the distant entrance of the grotto, and 
moves very slowly across; when it reaches the center 
of the opening it sinks at the sound of the gong and 
flash of lightning at back.  Music. Hurry. All the 
gnomes, amphibia, etc., utter exclaminations of delight 
and indulge in extravagant antics, until checked by a 
gesture from Stalacta.  Soft music.  Dragonfin rises slowly 
from water (C), supporting on either side Rodolphe 
and Greppo, the latter gasping violently for breath as 
his head appears.  They step on shore, Rodolphe and Greppo
lost in bewilderment.  Dragonfin bows low before Stalacta.  
The other amphibia and gnomes make a demonstration of 
attack.]</stage>

Forbear. Who moves again till I alone command, shall perish.</p>\

[They retire.]

</sp>

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
<stage>
[Rubbing his eyes.]</stage>
Is this a phantasm--this glittering gold, yon flashing gems, 
these strange, fantastic shapes?  Have I, then, passed the portal 
of an unknown world, or am I dreaming?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>
Welcome, brave mortal, to our bright domain, and you, my subjects, 
know and greet your Queen&#39;s preserver.</p></sp>
<stage>
[Music.  Gnomes and amphibia cluster around Rodolphe 
and Greppo, rolling at their feet and indulging in various 
grateful antics, after which the fairies surround 
them and evince their delight.]
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Still bewildered.]</stage>
If this, indeed, be not a dream, tell me, bright being, you 
whose simple motion seems to sway the moods and passions of 
this elfin band, who art thou and where am I?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>I am called Stalacta, Queen of this dazzling realm. The glittering 
wonders that assail thine eyes are not creations of 
fantastic dreams, but nature&#39;s handiwork, wrought with cunning 
fingers in a bounteous mood.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Who has picked up a large mass of gold at back, comes 
forward.]</stage>
&#39;Tis true, master, &#39;tis true.  Behold this shining nugget!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Who is thy droll companion?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
My simple henchman, a faithful guide and servitor!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>I bid him welcome for his master&#39;s sake.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
Thanks, thanks, your resplendent majesty, thanks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
You speak of service done; have we, then, met before?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
Yes, once.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Indeed!  When?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>This very night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
To-night?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
To-night, in the Glen of Fire; but not as now.  Then, a poor 
weak, fluttering, charm-encompassed bird, you snatched me 
from the jaws of death, broke the dark spell of transformation, 
and gave to me the priceless boon of liberty.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
I do remember--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Grep.</speaker><p>
And so do I.  Phew! how the sparks flew when master smashed 
the head of the scaly monster, and such a smell of brimstone!   
I do believe it was one of the Belzebub&#39;s own imps in disguise.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Again thou art welcome.  This is my natal hour--wilt view the 
sports of this our carnival?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Most willingly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>And while the revels proceed thou shalt tell me thy story.
</p></sp>
<stage> 
[Music.  Seats are brought forward by amphibia R.H. 1st ent.;  
Stalacta and Rodolphe sit ; Greppo disposes himself L. H. 1st ent., 
amusing himself with Dragonfin, gnomes and amphibia, 
who present him from time to time with nuggets of gold 
and jewels, which he thrusts into his pockets until they 
become greatly distended, during which action the diminutive 
sprites reappear in shells on water, floating 
to and fro, fishing.  The fairies form for dance as at first.  Grand 
ballet action by principals and full corps de ballet, 
during which the fishers in the shells are seen to catch small silver fish.
</stage>

<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p><stage>[Rising and leading Rodolphe forward.]</stage>
Thy story claims for thee my pity and my aid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
And Hertzog, the Black Crook--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Is a vile sorcerer, whose dark, unhallowed spells 
were wrought for thy destruction.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>
Beneath the entrance to this charmed spot lie intertwined 
among the branches of the coraline whole hecatombs of human 
bones, the whitened relics of adventurous mortals who, like 
thyself, have sought this realm.  Until to night, no human eye 
has ever seen the dazzling splendor of this wondrous dome ;  
no human footsteps save thine own and his who follows thee 
have ever pressed these sands of gold. Had not thy coming 
been to me forshadowed, and all my power been interposed to 
snatch thee from the impending doom, thou, too had&#39;st joined 
the hapless throng that mouldering lies beneath yon depths.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Then is thy debt to me already paid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stal.</speaker><p>Not so.  I am still thy debtor,
 and must ever be.  Thou art environed by danger, and need the power of 
 my protection.  Return unto the outer world again ; thy happiness is there.  She 
whom thou lovest is worthy of thy love; therefore return.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Amina, dear Amina!
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stal.</speaker>
<p>In the secret cells of this cavern, whose walls are solid gold, 
lie counteless hoards of richest treasure, gleaned for ages 
by the tireless gnomes.  In the crystal depths of these 
waters sparkle gems richer by far than human eyes have ever 
gazed upon ;  of these thou shalt bear with thee the choicest.
Behold my gift!</p>
<stage>
[Music.  A golden 
boat, studded with jewels, glides on from L. H. to L. C.]</stage>
<p>This bark, protected by a potent spell, loaded with rich and costly jewels, shall 
bear thee safely 
to yon neighboring shore.  My faithful gnomes shall be thy 
treasure bearers.  But ere we part take thou this jewelled 
circlet.</p>
<stage>
[Gives him a ring from her finger.]
</stage>
<p>Should danger threaten, as perchance it will, for baffled 
malice has a thousand stings, press but thy lips upon the gem 
and thou wilt find me by thy side.</p>

[Raising him.]

<p>
Farewell!

[Music.  He steps into the boat ; Greppo, bearing 
a large mass of gold, affectionately embraces Dragonfin,
shakes hands with the gnomes and amphibia, kisses the 
fairies, bows low to Stalacta and gets into the boat.
A dolphin glittering in green and gold rises from behind
2d or 3d set water, with principal danseuse 
bearing a vase of treasure ; other dolphins float on 
R. and L., with diminutive sprites bearing treasure.  Copious 
shower of gold, the other sprites on the water catching 
the flakes in silver shells.  Poses by gnomes, amphibia 
and fairies.  The whole scene brilliantly lighted. Tableaux and 
slow curtain.

<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><stage>[R.H. casting sidelong glance at him.] </stage>
<p>Heigho!  There he is!  My charms tonight have completed the 
conquest.  He&#39;s fast bound in the bonds of rosy cupid.  I see 
a proposal in one eye and a marriage settlement in the other, 
But I mustn&#39;t draw him in too suddenly.  These men are like 
trout--they must be played with a little.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Full moon of the festival, why have you so cruelly robbed 
the grand hall of your light, and left us to grope about in 
the dull glimmer of the sickly stars.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me about moonshine and sickly stars, you heartless, 
gay deceiver.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Deceiver?

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Deceiver!  Did&#39;st I see you gallivanting with the fraulein 
Von Scragneck, the new Burgonmaster&#39;s daughter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
Politeness, my dear madam Barbara, merely politeness on my 
honor.  The fact is, I-I had the misfortune to tread on the 
lady&#39;s favorite bunion, and what you mistook for tenderness 
was only an apology-an apology, believe me, my dear madam 
Barbara, only an apology.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Oh, you men, you deceiving men, you are always ready with an 
excuse.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p>
On the honor of a Von Puffengruntz, I swear I speak the truth.
The fraulein Von Skragneck, indeed!  Haven&#39;t I got eyes?  Ah, 
cruel fair one, compared with her and all others, you are 
as the stately sunflower in a meadow of dandelions;  As--as--as the 
queen hollyhock in a garden of chickweed.

It&#39;s coming at last, I know it&#39;s coming.<stage>
[pressing her heart,]</stage>
what a strange flutter; I hope I&#39;m not going to faint ; dear 
me, what poor, weak, silly creatures we are ; I must nerve myself

Music, chord and hurry--she utters a piercing scream and rushes off R.H. 1st ent.  
Dragonfin indulges in extravagant antics 
until music changes, when he starts, inclines his ear 
to the ground and listens, rises, moves cautiously to R.H. 1st ent. ;  
starts, points off R.H., shakes his clenched hand threateningly, 
and quickly disappears through trap R.H.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Hert.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Entering R.H. 1st ent. hurriedly and disturbed.]</stage>
Foiled, tricked, crossed in the hour of my victory.  A life 
desperately played for and fairly won, snatched from the jaws 
of death.  He lives! My chosen victim lives, and flushed with 
triumph and vast hoards of gold, stalks boldly forth to mock 
me.  Oh, curse the interposing power that stepped between us.  
A withering palsy light upon her arm, and blight and pestilence infect 
the air she breathes!  Oh, impotent, driveling 
fool!  To work! To work!  A soul once tempered with must 
be pursued, not cast aside to tempt another.  So runs the bond 
to which I&#39;ve sealed.  &#39;Tis well! &#39;Tis well!  I&#39;ll track him 
as the sleuth-hound tracks the stag!  He must, he shall be 
mine.</p></sp>

[Music,] exit L.H. 1st ent.</stage>
<stage>[Enter from terrace L.H. Rodolphe and Amina.  He is brilliantly

<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Oh, dear Rodolphe, is this a dream?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
What&#39;s past seems so ; but day has dawned on our long-clouded 
night, and this the awakening.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Your story is indeed most wondrous.  But oh, dear Rodolphe,
I tremble for your life. If you should be discovered, the 
vengeance of the ruthless Wolfenstein, backed by his horde 
of fierce retainers, would be most terrible.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Fear not. I will defend my right with my life.  The same kind 
power that interposed between me and destruction protects us 
still.  You shall be saved.  All is ready for our flight. 
On the border of the forest, beyond the boundary of the gardens, 
swift horses are concealed.  After midnight, the moon, 
veiling her face behind the Brocken, will throw a deep shadow 
over the valley.  When all is quiet, I will be beneath your 
window--the rest is easy.  Carline and my faithful Greppo 
will accompany us.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Throwing her arms around him.]</stage>
Oh, my Rodolphe, my more than life! Coming thus suddenly 
from the darkness of my despair into the sunlight of this 
new-born hope dazzles me; my eyelids close; I cannot 
look this great joy in the face; I fear to call it mine.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker><p>
Fear?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Am.</speaker><p>
Fear with that fear that springs from woman&#39;s love.

<sp><speaker>Rod.</speaker>

Be calm, sweet love. Be brave, and all will yet be well.</p></sp>

Hark! The masquers come this way.  Let&#39;s mingle with the 
throng.</p><stage>[They mask and cross to L.H. 1st ent.]</stage></sp>

<stage>[Music. Louder.  Masquers enter L. and R., laughing and conversing. 
While so engaged, and after all 
are on, music changes to hurry. Hertzog with drawn 
sword, enters hurriedly at terrace, L.H., followed 
quickly by guards.  
Wolfenstein with drawn sword, Wulfgar, Bruno, and last 
Von Puffengruntz and Barbara, the two latter remaining on terrace.

<sp><speaker>Wol.</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis said a serf, a wretch, 
usurping the semblance of a noble 
prince, and bent on outrage has dared to mingle with this 
goodly throng.  If this be false, to all I&#39;ll make amends for 
this rude breaking in upon the general joy.  If it be true, 
&#39;tis fit we know it, therefore I do command that all shall 
here unmask.

Lost, Lost!

Aye, let all unmask!</p></sp>

draws his sword, and places himself before Amina.

[Music.  Ladies scream, Amina faints is caught in  
the arms of Greppo, who enters L.H. 1st ent.  Wolfenstein, Wulfar, Bruno and guards 
are rushing upon Rodolphe.]

The Ring, master, the Ring.</p></sp>
<stage>[Rodolphe kisses the ring;  Lights up quick ; Stalacta
 springs from L. H. 1st ent.,in glittering  mail, with helmet, sword and
  shield, followed by 
Dragonfin, armed with a trident ; gnomes and amphibea with
 knotted clubs and tridents form L. H. 2d and 3d entrances, and 
  and on terrace R. and L. ; Fairies and Nymps as 
  Amazons, with breast plates, shields, helmets and 
  javalins, from L. H. 1st ent.  Wolfenstein, 
guards and gentlemen shrink back appalled.  Herzog 
stands the embodiment of baffled rage.  Von Puffengruntz on 
terrace faints and falls into the arms of Barbara, who 
fans him.  Tableaux and quick curtain.]</stage>

<stage>
Note--From the cue &quot;hew him to pieces.&quot;, the whole action 
must be hurried and simultaneous ; foot and stage lights flashed 
quickly up when Rodolphe kisses the ring.  When curtain drops

Scene I.--An apartment in the castle

<stage>[Music.  Enter Barbara, R.H.]
		</stage>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Alas that things ever fall so ill.  &#39;Tis now six months 
since that never-to-be-forgotten night and still no news 
of the lost mistress of Wolfenstein ; nor yet of his lordship 
who has sworn an oath never to return to the castle until 
he has brought her back, and revenged himself on the horrible 
monster who has stolen her.  And that graceless baggage, Carline, 
too, to go off at the same time, leaving all the cares 
of the household to fall on my poor shoulders ; and then to 
make the matter worse, spells and witchcraft turn all things 
upside down.  The cows milk vinegar.  The wells are dry.  The 
hens lay haddled eggs.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><p><stage>
[Entering R.H. with a very red nose and tipsey.]</stage>
And all the wine&#39;s turned sour.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>[Looking ruefully at him.]</stage>
There&#39;s another comfort.  To think that <emph>I</emph>, the right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph rend="underline">was</emph> to have been, to her right honorable 
ladyship that <emph>was</emph> to have been ; for whom many a young and 
tender heart has sighed in vain, should ever have thrown herself 
away upon a wine butt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
A wine-butt, Madam Van Puffengruntz?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Aye, a wine-butt--a beer barrel--a brute that hasn&#39;t drawn a 
sober breath since the day we were married, now more 
than three months ago.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
A beer-barrel!

<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Savagely.]</stage>
I said a beer-barrel.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
Certainly ; of course, just which ever you please, my 
dear, wine butt or beer barrel, its all the same to me ; 
you know you will cackle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Cackle?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
Cackle, my dear.  You know I never have a moment&#39;s peace.  
You&#39;re not even quiet when you&#39;re asleep ; you snore, Madam 
Von Puffengrunz, you snore, loud enough to split the drum 
of my ear and rip up the seam up my night-cap.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Snore!  you wretch!  I snore?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
Yes, my dear, and have the night-mare. [Hic.]  I don&#39;t 
like a wife that snores, and I hate a wife that has the night-mare.  
In future, I am going to have separate apartments.  Hereafter, 
I intend to sleep alone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Alone?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
I said alone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
Am I awake?  Who and what do you take me for?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Puf.</speaker><stage>[Hic.]</stage><p>
I took you for a gentle spice--a sort of seasoning 
to the dull life I led here in the castle--but damn it, Madam, 
you&#39;ve turned out to be all the condiments in one--a bottom 
layer of mustard, a top dressing of cayenne pepper, and a subeterranean 
lake of vinegar in the middle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker><p>
<stage>[Enraged and approaching him--he retreats around L. H.]</stage>
Cackle!  snore!  nightmare! separate apartments!  cayenne 
pepper!  You wretch!  You--you sot! you villain!  I&#39;ll pepper you!

I weary with the chase.  Call together our people and bid

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis wisely resolved, good master.  The sun declines, and night 
comes on apace, and we are yet some three good miles from home,  
besides, I&#39;m hollow as a drum.  Moreover, in early autumn venison 
keeps not over long, and the fat haunch of yonder noble 
stag cries out for speedy roasting.  Pray do not tarry long.</p>

Well, dear love, to-morrow ends the year of our probation.

To-morrow!  How brief the time, and yet how long &#39;till then!  
Oh, Rodolphe, will it come to us?  There seems to be a lurking

False wretch! But that another life hangs on the slender thread

try this issue with my single sword.  But know thou still
art juggled with.  The power I once invoked is potent still.

What&#39;s the use?  Now what <emph>is</emph> the use?  The oftener I call 
the fainter comes the answer.  Here it is quite dark. Master

some devil&#39;s work going on.
<stage>[Starting.]</stage>

I beg his infernal Majesty&#39;s pardon. I hope I have not said 
anything to offend ; but strange sights and sounds are in the 
air.  Birds that ought to have been to roost an hour ago, fly 
screaming from tree to tree.  The dismal screech-owl, from 
its hole in the oak, answers to the croak of the dreary 
monk-raven ; and just now I saw a big fat buck scampering through 
the forest with his tail on fire.  Oh dear! Oh dear! what 
fearful omens!  And I&#39;m to be married to-morrow.  If anything 
should happen to me!  If my poor, dear, darling little Carline should 
happen to be left a widow before she&#39;s made a wife--if I 
should never taste--that is, if I should never know--Oh, 
Lord! it won&#39;t bear thinking of.  I&#39;ll try once more.

Pandemonium (in 2 or 3).  Zamiel in council, seated on an illuminated

		Music at opening of scene!  Fiends discovered

		waves his sceptre.  Demons separate and form R. and L.

<stage>[Music. The demons utter a wild wail of delight and 
resume the dance. The gong strikes twleve.  At the first 
stroke the demons cease dancing, and hold separate 
pictures of exulatation.  At the termination of each 
stroke a single brazen blast of demoniacal music.  At the 
twelfth stroke, loud and continued thunder. Demons utter a wild 
cry ; Zamiel rises, waves his sceptre.  (If possible, 
the scene breaks away and discovers vistas of Pandemonium, in 3,  
teeming with infernal life and wreaths of flame, 
from which appear illuminated heads of demons, skeletons, 
and nondescript monsters.)  Gong sounds.  Hertzog is dragged 
on from R.H. by fiends and is dashed into burning 
chasm which opens.  Demons howl and dance around till closed in.</stage>
