Scene 1st-- A quiet valley at the foot of the Hartz Mountains. Cottage of Dame Barbara R. H. 3rd Ent. with practicable upper window and balcony. Set tree beside cottages, at back Set arbor L.H. 3rd ent. Broken water and rustic stone bridge or long rocky trail piece with platform from R to L backed by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs above which light clouds appear, illuminated by the reflected light of the moon. Shortly after rise of curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon. 
</div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_152">
MUSIC at rise of curtain--enter Rodolphe, at back, R. H. He descends, comes forward and after looking cautiously around claps his hands three times beneath the window. The upper window opens and Amina appears on balcony.
</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_153"><div class="speaker" id="bc_154">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Surely I heard his well-known signal. 
Hist, who's there?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_156"><div class="speaker" id="bc_157">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Tis I, Rodolphe!
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_159"><div class="speaker" id="bc_160">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Rodolphe! Hush speak low, if my foster mother still sleeps, I will join you.
<div class="inner_stage">(retires.)</div> 
</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_163">
(Music. Rodolphe goes upstage and looks cautiously off, then comes down --
Amina enters from cottage.)
</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_164">
<div class="speaker" id="bc_165">Amina</div>
<div class="inner_stage">
(Throwing herself into his arms)</div>
<div class="p">Rodolphe!</div></div> 
<div class="sp" id="bc_168"><div class="speaker" id="bc_169">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
My own!
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_172"><div class="speaker" id="bc_173">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
When did you return?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_175"><div class="speaker" id="bc_176">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
'Twas past midnight: although wearied and footsore I could not sleep until I had seen you.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_178"><div class="speaker" id="bc_179">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Oh, how wearily the days and nights have passed since you left me! What kept you so long?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_181"><div class="speaker" id="bc_182">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Ill fortune, Amina. After reaching Gottingen and finding no purchaser for my picture I heard that there was a wealthy traveller at Cassel, collecting works of art. 
I had but four silver florins in my pocket yet I hopefully set out to meet him. After journeying five whole days I arrived at Cassel only to find that the traveller had departed two days before.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_184"><div class="speaker" id="bc_185">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
And your beautiful picture -- upon which so much of our future was built -- you have brought it back?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_187"><div class="speaker" id="bc_188">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
No. Crushed in my last hope to obtain the means necessary to our union I left it with a remorseless agent for a pittance barely sufficient for subsistence during my journey homeward, and here I am without a single guilder in my pocket! And what is worse if I fail to redeem my pledge at the end of two months it is lost to me forever.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_190"><div class="speaker" id="bc_191">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">(Aside)</div> Poor, dear Rodolphe, he knows not the worst--the heaviest blow is yet to come, How shall I break it to him? <div class="inner_stage">(Aloud)</div> Dear Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you made me forget for a moment that which I fear to tell you.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_195">
(The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon grow ruddy with the rising sun.)</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_196"><div class="speaker" id="bc_197">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Fear to tell me! Speak, what has happened?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_199"><div class="speaker" id="bc_200">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Be calm and listen. Last week I attended the festival of St. John, in company with the other members of the village choir. Upon raising my eyes after we had finished the anthem I found a dark, strange man gazing upon me. 
A moment after he quitted the spot I enquired who he was and learned that it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all powerful lord of this wide domain.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_202"><div class="speaker" id="bc_203">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Well.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_205"><div class="speaker" id="bc_206">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Although I met his gaze but for a moment, I felt that it boded evil to me--to us.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_209"><div class="speaker" id="bc_210">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Evil! Evil to us?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_213"><div class="speaker" id="bc_214">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears idle, the next day brought him here to our humble abode--he told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_216"><div class="speaker" id="bc_217">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">(Starting)</div> Loved!--You?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_220"><div class="speaker" id="bc_221">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in obscurity--that we should be removed to the castle--that masters should be provided for my suitable education, and in a year I should take the place of the late Countess of Wolfenstein.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_223"><div class="speaker" id="bc_224">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
And dame Barbara?----</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_226"><div class="speaker" id="bc_227">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Joyfully consented. This very day is set apart for our removal. The escort will be here at sunrise.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_229"><div class="speaker" id="bc_230">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
And you, Amina, You?---</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_232"><div class="speaker" id="bc_233">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_235"><div class="speaker" id="bc_236">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p"><div class="inner_stage">
(Vehemently)</div> By Heaven, you shall not go.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_239"><div class="speaker" id="bc_240">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_242">
(Dame Barbara appears on the balcony)</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_243"><div class="speaker" id="bc_244">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
I say you shall not! Were he twenty times more potent I would oppose his power to the last.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_246"><div class="speaker" id="bc_247">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till I get down! <div class="inner_stage">(MUSIC she disappears from balcony and enters from door--)</div>
What, jade, ingrate! how dare you? 
Is this your gratitude? Where is your pride? Now, the most noble Countess of Wolfenstein that is to be meeting young men in secret and on the very day of your bethrothal. Oh, if his high mightiness the Count should find it out!</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_250"><div class="speaker" id="bc_251">Amina</div>
<div class="p">
But mother --</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_254"><div class="speaker" id="bc_255">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
Not a word-- how dare you? In with you, into the house, I say! <div class="inner_stage">(Forces her into the cottage, closes the door, then turns to Rodolphe)</div> So, beggar, you've come back have you? How dare you show your unlucky face here at such a time as this! I had hoped you had fallen into the hands of the conscript officers and gone for a soldier, or better still, been carried off by the demons of the Brocken.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_258"><div class="speaker" id="bc_259">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
And yet you see I've escaped both. 
Hark ye, dame. I love Amina, she loves me, you yourself promised that she should be mine as soon as I could command a hundred silver crowns.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_261"><div class="speaker" id="bc_262">
Barbara
</div>
<div class="p">
Pah, that was before I knew her value, but now that I do know it and others know it too, I've changed my mind. But where are the hundred crowns?--Where's the for-
tune you were to get for your great pain-
ting? I warrant me you haven't got a single groschen of it. Come, let me see the hundred crowns.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_265"><div class="speaker" id="bc_266">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
My picture is not yet sold.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_268"><div class="speaker" id="bc_269">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
Ha, ha! Didn't I say so, not yet sold eh? Here's a pretty fellow, that would take a young girl from her comfortable home, a good bed, sweet milk and egg-pudding, to lodge her on pea-straw, and feed her at best on black bread and sour cheese. Oh, was there ever such villainy?
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_271"><div class="speaker" id="bc_272">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p">
Nay, but listen to me.
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_274"><div class="speaker" id="bc_275">
Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
Not a word; begone, do you think people of quality have nothing to do but listen to beggars complaints, and above all at such a time as this? Begone, I say, this is to be a festival day, the maidens of the village will be here anon; the grand escort will be here, headed by the Count's chamberlain, 
Aye, and his Lordship the Count himself will be here, to bear the Countess that is to be and her right honorable foster-mother that is to be to the Castle.
<div class="inner_stage">(Music)</div> Hark, here come the villagers already: Out of the way I say.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_280">
(Pushes him rudely aside, goes up and looks off RH--Rodolphe retires into the arbor.)</div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_281">
(Enter lively from RH at back, female villagers with garlands, followed by males, two of whom bear a rustic chair, festooned with flowers. They descend and come forward, greeting the Dame. Females LH males RH at back. The sun appears above one of the spurs of the Mountains.)
</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_282"><div class="speaker" id="bc_283">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">(Down RH)</div> Ah, you are early, friends.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_286"><div class="speaker" id="bc_287">Carline</div>
<div class="p">
Yes, but not earlier than the sun, for see, it is already peeping over the great toe of the Brocken. But where's Amina?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_289">
<div class="speaker" id="bc_290">
Barbara
</div>
<div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">(Drawing herself up)</div>
The Countess that is to be is preparing to receive his lordship the Count. But never mind her ladyship, enjoy yourselves until she is ready. Here, Casper, here I am, come with me and bring some refreshments while I help to prepare her ladyship <div class="inner_stage">(Goes into the cottage followed by Casper and Jan. The two latter re-enter with white cloth, wine, fruits, etc. which they arrange on the table beneath the tree)</div>
</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_295"><div class="speaker" id="bc_296">Carline</div>
<div class="p">
Bless me, how grand Dame Barbara has grown, to be sure. If she goes on at this rate the wide halls of the grand old Castle of Wolfenstein will be a world too small to hold her. I hope this piece of good fortune will not make such a fool of dear 'Mina

Oh, 'tis said he has gone for a soldier-- 
But come, while 'Mina is making ready let us rehearse our Festival Dance.</div></div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_304">
(Music: Grand Garland Dance by principals and full Ballet, during which the Males gather around the table and eat and drink. After dance, Barbara re-enters extravagantly dressed, wearing a monstrous cap ridiculously trimmed)</div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_305"><div class="speaker" id="bc_306">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
There! Having completed her ladyships toilet I have attended to my own, and, if I know anything about dress, I flatter myself that my appearance would do honor to any occasion.

<div class="p">Mercy on us, was there ever such a fright! Why she looks for all the world like a great horned owl dressed up in the cast-off finery of a peacock. Ha, ha, ha, Did you ever? 
Observe me tickle the old buzzard.

Why! Dame Barbara, is that you?</div></div> 
<div class="sp" id="bc_314"><div class="speaker" id="bc_315">Barbara</div>
<div class="p">
<div class="inner_stage">(Drawing herself up)</div>Of course it is, child. 
Who else should it be?<div class="inner_stage">(Aside)</div> I knew I should make them open their eyes.</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_319">
<div class="speaker" id="bc_320">Carline</div>
<div class="p">
Why you've almost taken away my breath. I declare, Dame, you're looking gorgeous--so young and girlish too.

<div class="p">
And why not, pray?</div></div>
<div class="sp" id="bc_325"><div class="speaker" id="bc_326">Carline</div>

Indeed, Dame Barbara, I was never more serious in my life.

Mercy on us, what a crash! But pshaw, why hsould I care how the tempest rages without. Am I not safe within, and in rare good luck too? Only to think that I should be chosen from among all the girls in the village to become Amina's companion and own particular waiting maid. Old Hagar, the gypsy fortune teller whose palm I crossed with a new quarter florin last week told me that good fortune awaited me, and sure enough, here it is. Only to think of it, that I, Carline Brenner , who for ten long years have been chained to a stupid spinning wheel day an night should become confidential companion to the future mistress of Wolfenstein. Was there ever such good fortune? I declare, I am so happy I could sing for a month.

Nothing? To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of last night nothing? Why the thunder creashed over the castle loud enough to wake the dead.

Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the brutes ever were known to have been unruly. I promise that they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed. But I too am criminal. The apartments were selected by me because they command the best view of the mountains.

Rising from out its deadly coil itself, when suddenly a youth, a mortal, strangely present in that wildwood spot, seeing the danger of the trembling bird seized a dead bough, which chance had fashioned like a holy cross, and smote the foul thing dead. Then bore me safely from the charmed spot and gave me life and liberty.</div></div>

<div class="outer_stage" id="bc_2085">
Scene: Pandemonium. ZAMIEL in council, seated on an illuminated throne of skulls &amp; flame at back C. To R &amp; L of C, lesser thrones, that on the right occupied by Redglare, with pen and open book, that on the left by a secretary writing. At the foot of the central throne two dwarf-demons, pages with wands in attendance. MUSIC AT RISE. Fiends discovered in a chorus of demoniacal yells and fiendish laughter, dancing around a flashing chasm. After the action is continued a brief time, ZAMIEL waves his sceptre. Demons separate and form R &amp; L.

'Tis well. Let silence reign awhile. How stands the record of the dying year? Has every seed brought sinful fruit? Is all the harvest gathered in--is every bond fulfilled?

At the first stroke, the demons cease dancing and hold separate pictures of exulatation. At the termination of each stroke loud and continued thunder; demons utter a wild cry. Zamiel rises and waves his sceptre. If possible the scene breaks away and discloses vistas of Pandemonium teeming with infernal life &amp; wreaths of flame, from which appear illuminated heads of demons, skeletons, &amp; nondescript monsters. Gong sounds. HERTZOG is dragged on from RH2 by fiends and is dashed into the flaming chasm. Demons howl and dance around until</div>

MUSIC AT RISE. Characteristic march. Grand procession of amphibea &amp; gnomes bearing in their arms and upon their heads salvers and shells and quaint vases filled with gold and jewels. They are followed by Amazons in armor, led by Stalacta. They march from L to R, doubling the march and varying the evolutions
