<head>Act 1st</head>
<stage>
Scene 1st--	A quiet valley at the foot of
the Hartz Mountains.  Cottage of Dame Barbara
R. H.  3rd Ent. with practicable upper window 
and balcony.  Set tree beside cottage, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
low rustic stone bridge or long rocky trail
piece, with platform from R. to L. backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs
above which light clouds appear, 
illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtains the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon. 
</stage>
<stage>
Music () at rise of curtain--enter 
Rodolphe, at back, R. H.  He descends, comes 
forward, and after looking cautiously 
around, claps his hands three times beneath 
the window.  The upper window opens 
and Amina appears on balcony.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p>
<delSpan resp="1">Surely I heard his well-known signal.</delSpan>  
Hist, who&#39;s there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Tis I, Rodolphe!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker> <add><stage>Joyfully</stage></add><p>
Rodolphe!  Hush speak low, if my foster
mother still sleeps, I will join you. <stage>(retires.)</stage>  
</p></sp>
<stage>
#Music# ()  Rodolphe goes upstage and 
looks cautiously off, then comes down --
Amina enters from cottage.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<stage>
(Throwing herself into his arms)</stage><p>Rodolphe!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My own!
</p></sp>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
When did you return?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
&#39;Twas past midnight:  although wearied and 
footsore I could not sleep until I had seen 
you.
</p></sp></delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Oh, how wearily the days and nights have 
passed since you left me!  What kept you 
so long?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Ill fortune, Amina.<delSpan resp="1">  After reaching Gottingen
and finding no purchaser for my picture 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
And your beautiful picture -- upon which 
so much of our future was built -- you 
have brought it back?</p></sp></delSpan>
<sp><delSpan resp="1"><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker></delSpan><p>
<delSpan resp="1">No. </delSpan> Crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union I 
left <delSpan resp="1">it</delSpan><add>my picture</add> with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am without a single guilder in my pocket, and what is worse if I fail to redeem 
my pledge at the end of two months, it 
is lost to me forever.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
<stage>(Aside)</stage> <delSpan resp="1">Poor, dear Rodolphe,</delSpan> he knows not 
the worst<delSpan resp="1">--the heaviest blow is yet to come, How shall I break it to him? </delSpan><stage>(Aloud)</stage> Dear 
Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you 
made me forget for a moment that which 
I fear to tell you.</p></sp>
<stage>
(The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon 
grow ruddy with the rising sun.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Fear to tell me!  Speak, what has happened?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Be calm and listen.  Last week I attended 
the Festival of St. John, <add>Be calm and listen!  last week I attended the Festival
of St. John, where I was observed by Count Wolfenstein--
the all powerful Lord of this wide domain--the next day was an evil 
one to us my Rudolphe, for it brought him here to this poor 
cottage; to tell my foster mother, that he loved me! 
 </add><delSpan resp="1"> in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir.  Upon raising my eyes after we 
had finished the anthem I found a 
dark, strange man gazing upon me.  
A moment after he quitted the spot. 
I enquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful Lord of this wide domain.</delSpan></p></sp>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Although I met his gaze but for a moment, 
I felt that it boded evil to me--to <emph rend="underline"> us</emph>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Evil!  Evil to <emph rend="underline">us</emph>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears 
idle, the next day brought him here to 
our humble abode--he told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</p></sp></delSpan>

<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<stage>(Starting)</stage> Loved!--You?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in 
obscurity--that we should be removed to the 
castle<delSpan resp="1">--that masters should be provided for 
my suitable education,</delSpan> and in a year 
I should take the place of the late Countess 
of Wolfenstein.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
And dame Barbara?----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Joyfully consented.  This very day is set 
apart for our removal.<delSpan resp="1">  The escort will 
be here at sunrise.</delSpan></p></sp>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
And you, Amina, You?---</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you 
know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p><stage>
(Vehemently)</stage> By Heaven, you shall not go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>
Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<stage>
(Dame Barbara appears on the balcony)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<delSpan resp="1">I say</delSpan><add>By Heaven!</add> you shall not <add>go</add>!  Were he twenty 
times more potent I would oppose his 
power to the last.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till 
I get down! <stage>#Music#() She disappears 
from balcony and enters from door)</stage>
What, jade, ingrate!  how dare you?  
Is this your gratitude?  Where is your 
pride?  You, the most noble Countess 
of Wolfenstein that <emph>is</emph> to be, meeting 
young men in secret and on the very 
day of your bethrothal.  Oh, if his high
mightiness the Count should find it out!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Amina</speaker><p>

But mother --</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Not a word, how dare you?  In with you, 
into the house, in I say!<delSpan resp="2"><stage>(Forces her into the 
cottage, closes the door, then turns to 
Rodolphe)</stage> So, beggar, you&#39;ve come back,
have you?  How dare you show your 
unlucky face here at such a time as 
this! <delSpan resp="1">I had hoped you&#39;d fallen into 
the hands of the conscript officers and
gone for a soldier, or better still, been 
carried off by the demons of the Brocken.</delSpan></delSpan></p></sp>
<delSpan resp="2">
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
<delSpan resp="1"> And yet you see I&#39;ve escaped both.</delSpan>  
Hark ye, dame.  I love Amina, she 
loves me, you yourself promised that 
she should be mine as soon as I could 
command a hundred silver crowns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
Barbara
</speaker><p>
 Pah, that was before I knew her value, 
 <delSpan resp="1">but 
now that I <emph rend="underline"> do</emph> know it and others know it 
too, I&#39;ve changed my mind.</delSpan>  But where 
are the hundred crowns? Where&#39;s the fortune 
you were to get for your great painting?  
<delSpan resp="1">I warrant me you haven&#39;t got a 
single groschen of it.</delSpan>  Come, let me see the 
hundred crowns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
My picture is not yet sold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Ha, ha.  Did I not say so!  Not yet sold,
eh?  <delSpan resp="1">Here&#39;s a pretty fellow, that would 
take a young girl from her comfortable
home, a good bed, sweet milk and 
egg-pudding, to lodge her on pea-straw, 
and feed her at best on black bread and 
sour cheese.  Oh, was there ever such villainy?</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Nay, but listen to me.
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>
Barbara</speaker><p>
<add>And you beggar</add> Not a word; begone, do you think people of 
quality have nothing to do but listen to 
beggars complaints?  And above all at such 
a time as this?  Begone, I say, this is 
to be a festival day, the maidens of the 
village will be here anon; the grand escort 
will be here, headed by the Count&#39;s Chamberlain,  
aye, and his Lordship the Count 
himself will be here, to bear the Countess 
that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be and her right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to be to the Castle.
<stage>#Music#()</stage> Hark, here come the villagers 
already, Out of the way I say.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Pushes him rudely aside, goes up and 
looks off RH.  Rodolphe retires into 
the arbor.)</stage>
<stage>
Enter lively from RH at back, female 
villagers with garlands, followed by males, 
two of whom bear a rustic chair, festooned 
with flowers.  They descend and come 
forward, greeting the Dame.  Females L.H. 
males R. at back.  The sun appears 
above one of the spurs)
</stage>
<delSpan resp="1">
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Ah, you are early, friends.</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
<delSpan resp="1">Yes, but not earlier than the sun, for see, 
it is already peeping over the great toe 
of the Brocken.  </delSpan>But where&#39;s Amina?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>
Barbara
</speaker><p>
<stage>(Drawing herself up)</stage>
 The Countess that <emph rend="underline"> is</emph> to 
be is preparing to receive his lordship the 
Count.  But never mind her Ladyship, 
Enjoy yourselves until she is ready.  Here, 
<del>Casper</del><add>Wagner</add>, here I am, come with me and bring 
some refreshment while I help to prepare 
her ladyship <stage>(Goes into the cottage 
followed by Casper and Jan. The two latter 
re-enter with white cloth, wine, fruits,
etc.  which they arrange on table 
beneath the tree)<add>Well upstage out of the way.</add></stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
<delSpan resp="1">Bless me,</delSpan><add>Bless us 
and Save us!--What a long tail our host has got!</add>  
how grand Dame Barbara has 
grown, <delSpan resp="1">to be sure</delSpan><add>all on a 
sudden</add>!  If she goes on at this 
rate the wide halls of the grand old
Castle of Wolfenstein will be a world 
too small to hold her.  I hope this 
piece of good fortune will not make 
<delSpan resp="1">such</delSpan><add>as great</add> a fool of 
<add>our </add>dear &#39;Mina
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>
Rosetta
</speaker><p>
I don&#39;t understand this, I thought &#39;Mina 
was bethrothed to the handsome young 
painter Rodolphe,  what ever could 
have become of him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Oh, &#39;tis said he has gone for a soldier.  
But come <add>friends</add>, while &#39;Mina is making 
ready let us rehearse our Festival Dance.</p></sp>
<stage>
Music() Grand Garland Dance 
by principals and full Ballet,<delSpan> during 
which the Males gather around the table 
and eat and drink</delSpan>.  After dance, Barbara
re-enters extravagantly dressed, wearing a 
monstrous cap ridiculously trimmed)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
There!  Having completed her ladyships 
toilet I have attended to my own, and, 
if I know anything about dress, I flatter 
myself that my appearance would do 
honor to any occasion. <stage> (Displays herself)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to Rosetta)</stage><p>Mercy on us, was there 
ever such a <del>fright</del><add>jay</add>!  Why she looks for 
all the world like a great horned owl 
dressed up in the cast-off <del>finery</del><add>feathers</add>
 of a peacock.  <delSpan>Ha, ha, ha,  Did you ever? 
Observe</delSpan><add>Just you watch</add> me tickle the old buzzard.
<stage>(Aloud and with affected admiration)</stage>
Why, Dame Barbara, is that you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Drawing herself up)</stage>Of course it is, child.  
Who else should it be? <stage>(Aside)</stage> I knew 
I should make them open their eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Why you&#39;ve almost taken away my 
breath.  I declare, Dame, you&#39;re looking 
gorgeous!  So young and girlish too. <add>At first I thought 
it was Amina!</add>  
Indeed, if I were &#39;Mina--I beg pardon, 
I mean her Ladyship, I wouldn&#39;t 
care to have you in the way when 
his lordship the Count arrives.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And why not, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
 Because I should consider you a 
dangerous rival.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Nonesense, girl, you don&#39;t think so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Indeed, Dame Barbara, I was never more 
serious in my life. <stage>(Laughingly confers 
with Rosetta and villagers)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
It&#39;s strange I never noticed it before, but 
that girl Carline is a very sensible person.
<stage>Music ()</stage> Ah, here comes the escort!

from the arbor into the cottage unobserved.)</stage>

Male Villagers take off their caps and the 
females curtsey</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>

<stage>(L.H.) With pompous condescension)</stage> Be 
covered, good people, be covered; the air of 
the valley is yet damp.  We never insist

greatness to occasionally waive a point

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p> <stage>(Bowing)</stage> I cannot be mistaken, I was just 
about to inquire, but that stately presence

addressing Madam Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir. <stage>(Aside)</stage> How one&#39;s 
manner will betray one, I always said I 
belonged to a higher sphere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
I come, Madam, by the Count&#39;s order to announce 
that <delSpan resp="1">the cavalcade has arrived and is now 
resting on the plateau, beyond the ravine.</delSpan>
His lordship will be here presently, and in 
person conduct your fair foster-daughter

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
<stage>(Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir, his lordship is <emph>so</emph> considerate.  
But may I inquire if <emph rend="underline">I</emph> have 
been thought of?  Am I <emph rend="underline">also</emph> to be provided

by me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
That shall be my privilege

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Well, may it please your lordship, quite 
well, a little nervous from over-anxiety to 
see your lordship, but that&#39;s quite natural 
with us poor silly things, I suffered 
<emph rend="underline">dreadfully</emph> in that way when my poor

Many and many a time---</p></sp>

teller, whose palm I crossed with a new quarter florin 
last week told me that good fortune awaited me, and, sure enough, 
here it is.  Only to think of it, that I, Carline

<stage>(Hertzog rises)</stage>
<p>Why am I summoned?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
My life is waining.  Give me to live, feed the dull current 
of my sluggish veins. Give me fresh charms and potencies.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Wherefore?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Men hate and did they not fear would despise me.  I would 
repay their hate with hate.  I would live on, on, on, and in that 
life rival <emph>thy</emph> dread power of Evil.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
What wilt thou give for such a boon?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Whate&#39;er thou wilt, give me but life and all I have is thine.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis not enough.  What&#39;s thine is mine already.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
What else?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Listen.  A soul younger, fresher, whiter than thine, must 
on each recurring year be, by thy arts, turned to my account.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
I hear, dread master, and will pay the price.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Zamiel</speaker>
<p>For every soul thus lost to good and gained to me a years
new life is thine.  A single soul a single year.  A hundred 
souls a hundred years.  &#39;Tis with thyself to live forever.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Herzog</speaker><p>Forever!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Zamiel</speaker><p>
Forever!  But should the stroke of midnight fall a twelve-month
hence and no lost soul, by you betrayed within that 
time, come wailing at my gates, perdition closes on your dark 
career--Is&#39;t a compact?

<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker>
<p>There my fine fellow.  I think you&#39;re both safe and comfortable.  
No intruders--neither light nor sound ever comes 
here.  This should have been your lodging last 
night, but you see I mislaid the key. 
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Wretch.

<sp><speaker>Wulfgar</speaker>
<p>When you want exercise or change of air

<stage>(Pointing to chains)</stage>
You can take it in the vault beneath your feet.  Yonder trap leads 
to it.  You may find it a little mouldy and may stumble 
over the skeleton of the last lodger, but that&#39;s nothing.  
Any change is better than no change at all.

Monster, begone.

Oh, certainly, anything to oblige.  In the mean time if your

the portal of life?  No, no, it cannot be!  I must, I will 
burst these bonds.
<stage>(Music()  He makes an effort to break the chains.)</stage>
&#39;Tis vain, they defy even the strength of despair.

Hertzog, the Crook!

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Ill-omened bird, what brings <emph rend="underline"> you</emph> here?  <delSpan>Yet why should I ask?
You come the minister of death?  &#39;tis well, &#39;tis merciful,
begin your work.</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Out, foolish boy.  I serve no human master.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Then why are you here?
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>I come to give thee liberty.
</p></sp>
<delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Liberty!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye.  Listen.  I hate thine enemy, 
thou lov&#39;st a maid of whom 
thou hast been robbed. Would&#39;st win her back?  I have the 
power to aid thee.
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Begone, tempter.  I know your power and can guess from whence it 
comes.<delSpan>  Men say you deal in dark and necromantic spells 
that warp the senses and enthrall the soul.</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Pah!  Art thou, too, tainted 
with the vulgar fear that calls 
philosophy--the natural working of great Nature&#39;s laws--a spell 
of darkness? <delSpan> It is the light, weak boy, the light, which we 
sage men, who waste our lives oe&#39;r midnight lamps, glean from 
dull vapors for the sluggards&#39; use. </delSpan>  Fools sneer the most 
when least they understand and brand as foul what Nature stamps 
as fair.--Thy chains gall thee, let me loose them.
<stage>(He touches them with his staff--they fall to ground)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
What is your purpose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Again I say to serve thee.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Listen, I will tell thee a secret.  
She whom thou lovest is 
of noble birth.
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Amina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye, yet <emph>not</emph> Amina, 
but the only child and heiress of the 
noble house of Wellenstein stolen when but an infant by a 
revengeful gypsey <delSpan>whom her father scourged</delSpan> and given to gabbling 
Barbara.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Amina noble!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Aye, and thou of humble birth, but gold can buy nobility--
nay more, can give thee power to <delSpan>cross thine enemy.</delSpan><add>win Amina for 
thy bride!</add>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Why talk to me of gold--to <emph>me</emph>, the poorest of the poor? <delSpan>Whose 
purse contains not half so much as one poor silver mark.</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>Thou&#39;rt poor indeed, but thou <emph>art</emph>
 poor because thou <emph rend="underline">wilt</emph> be 
poor.  &#39;Tis with thyself to shame the wealth of the mighty Croesus.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
How?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
<p>Hast thou not heard of glittering gold in massive piles fast 
locked within these mountains?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
An idle tale, <delSpan>a senseless fable told by croning gossips. 
A treasure often sought but never found and some do say &#39;tis
death to seek it. </delSpan>
</p></sp>
<delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>I tell thee, boy, the story&#39;s true, this gold is palpable to 
sight and touch, and mayt be garnered too, if thou art bold 
enough.
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I&#39;ll hear no more!  Thou&#39;dst take advantage of my desperate 
strait to work some juggle to entrap my soul.  Begone, I say, 
begone!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>And leave thee to thy doom?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Aye.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>And thy affianced bride--would&#39;st thou 
so like a craven yield 
her up unto thine enemy?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Oh, agony!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
<p>&#39;Tis true she loves thee, but bethink thee boy, she is but 
woman and she may be won.  Her noble birth is known to Wolfenstein 
who means to wed her, and with her fortune to prop his 
falling house.  Already flattered by his serpent tounge, she 
dries her tears and listens to his suit.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis false!
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis true!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
The proof?

Behold.

What devilish compact would you have me sign?  Propose it

Come, philosopher or Fiend! Whate&#39;er thou art, the price, I 
say, the price. 
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Pah!  I ask no compact, I would serve thee gratis.  I but 
demand that thou shalt serve thyself.  Be rich and thou&#39;lt be 
powerful.  In thy revenge upon thine enemy and mine, thou&#39;lt
pay thy debt to me with interest.
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p> 
Where lies this wondrous treasure?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Listen.  Amid the fastnesses of the Hartz, beyond the outlet 
of the Black Gorge lies a small lake, whose waters few have 
ever gazen upon, for vulgar fear and superstitious dread have 
long since marked it for enchanted ground.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I&#39;ve heard the story.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
Trace carefully its northern shore, until a rock, rising like 
a wall, bars further passage. Beneath a fringe of tangled vines 
you&#39;ll find a boat concealed.  Behold this talismanic ring!
<stage>
(Takes a large ring from his finger)
</stage>
&#39;Tis a magnet of wondrous power.  When thou hast found the 
boat step boldly in, this ring will guide thee safely to the 
entrance of the goldern cavern within the compass of whose 
glittering walls thy wondering eyes may feast on wealth far 
greater than the coffers of the world can boast.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
Give me the ring.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
&#39;Tis thine!

<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
Dear master, I will reform, believe me, I will reform, allowance 
me to what would starve a mouse.  Nay, more, to pleasure 
you, I will not eat at all, I&#39;ll live on air, but do not cast 
me off.

<speaker>Hertzog</speaker><p>
I am resolved.  Behold thy future master.

Thou&#39;lt find him faithful, but he breeds a famine.  Take for

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me, girl.  Remember your station and consider 
mine.  Who am I and what am I that I should be lodged in a 
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself it was out of consideration for 
your ladyship&#39;s eyes.  Any little flurry does so spoil the 
natural beauty of their expression.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Carline, you&#39;re a good girl, you&#39;re a considerate girl and I 
forgive you, but eyes or no eyes, I&#39;ll not be imposed on.

Here he comes down the great stairway, as full of flesh and

And as the waddling old porpoise appears to have a liquorish 
tooth for this silly old buzzard, I&#39;ll leave them to bill and

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Eh, what, Madam Barbara, stirring so early!  Why, bless my 
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets 
of the castle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
There let it hang and be hanged to it!  Stirring indeed!  Haven&#39;t 
I been stirring all night.  Has not her ladyship been stirring all night 
and wouldn&#39;t the seven sleepers have 
been stirring all night, too, if they had lodged where I did?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Surely nothing has had the audacity to disturb <del>the quiet of 
your slumbers</del><add>you</add>?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Nothing!  To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night, nothing?  Why the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster mother that <emph rend="underline">is</emph> 
to be, to her right honorable ladyship that <emph rend="underline">is</emph> to be, 
passing the night in apartments overlooking a dog kennel.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
A dog-kennel?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night on 
raw meat by their one eyed keeper on purpose 
to give them the nightmare and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes ever were known to have been unruly.  I promise you that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I too am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they command the best view of the mountains.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
But I don&#39;t want to look at the mountains.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the North windows last night during the
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Beelzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubileee there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough.  If the mountain is 
unpleasant it shall be removed.  <add>No, no!  I mean you shall 
be removed.</add>

<stage>
The Grotto of Golden Stalactites--A grand and
comprehensive water cavern of gold, deeply perspective, 
with Stalactiform arched roof, cut 
wings, representing vistas, running parallel 
and harmonizing with that of the main grotto, 
the mouth of which (5 feet high by 5 feet wide) 
discloses an open lake and distant shore at 
back.  Set transparent silver waters, in which 
are seen sporting fishes and nondescript Amphibea. 
Diminutive fairies asleep on the waters 
of the grotto in golden shells.  Set ground or 
shore-piece richly studded with gold and jewels.  
Set masses of emerald and gold R, L, + C., upon 
and at the foot of which are reclining Gnomes 
and Amphibea.  Fairies asleep in poses R + L.
The Moon, seen through the opening at the back and 
over the distant shore of the lake, shows red 
upon its face at the opening of the scene.
</stage>
<stage>Music at change.  Shortly 
after which Dragonfin who has been asleep 
on a jewelled mass on the shore, Centre, slowly awakens, 
rises and stretches himself.  Upon turning

</stage>
<sp><speaker>Dragonfin</speaker>
<p>Mistress, but now the light in yon great Sapphire died out 
and stains of blood flushed in the face of the pale moon.  
You have &#39;scaped some deadly peril?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
<p>Thou art right.  Listen all, tonight while wandering in the 
fastnesses of the Hartz without my protecting talisman, I 
heedlessly trod within one of the charmed circles of our 
enemy, the Arch-fiend Zamiel.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
Omnes</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
<p>On the instant I was transformed into a white Dove, with 
shorn pinions,--From beneath the rank leaves of an adder-plant
glided a huge serpent.<delSpan>  Its eyes were burning coals,
its tongue a living flame.</delSpan>  I was paralyzed with fear and 
powerless to move.  <delSpan>Nearer and nearer it came.  I felt its 
stifling breath displace the purer air.  I saw its venomed 
fangs glist&#39;ning in the pale moonlight. </delSpan> Rising from out 
its deadly coil it poised itself to strike, when suddenly a youth--a 
mortal, strangely present in that wild, weird spot, seeing the 
danger of the trembling bird, seized a dead bough, which 
chance had fashioned like a holy cross, and smote the foul 
thing dead.  Then bore me safely from the charmed spot and 
gave me life and liberty!</p></sp>

All start in alarm and those hold the attitude of listening.  
The sound is repeated.  #Music#() hurry.  The 
pose is broken and the Fairies, Gnomes, and Amphibea

#Music# hurry() Dragonfin bows low, springs into
the water and disappears.  #Music#().  A small boat with 
two mechanical figures representing Rodolphe and 
Greppo, as they appeared in the mirror, appears from 
R.H. outside at the distance entrance of the grotto, and 
moves very slowly across.  When it reaches the centre

flash of lightning at back. </stage>
<stage>#Music#() hurry() All the 
Gnomes, Amphibea, etc. utter exclamations of delight

gesture from Stalacta.  #Soft music#()  Dragonfin rises slowly 
from water (C.) supporting on either side Rodolphe 
and Greppo, the latter gasping violently for breath as 
his head appears, they step on shore. Rodolphe and Greppo 
lost in bewilderment.  Dragonfin bows low before Stalacta,

Welcome, brave mortal, to our bright domain, and you my subjects-- 
know and greet your Queen&#39;s preserver.</p></sp>

grateful antics--After which the fairies surround 
them and evince their delight).</stage>

<stage>(Still bewildered)</stage>
If this indeed be not a dream, tell me, bright being, <delSpan>you 
whose simple motion seems to sway the moods and passions of 
this elfin band,</delSpan> who art thou and where am I?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
<p>I am called Stalacta, Queen of this dazzling Realm.  The glittering 
wonders that assail thine eyes are not creations of 
fantastic dreams, but Nature&#39;s handiwork<delSpan> wrought with cunning 
fingers in a bounteous mood</delSpan>.

<sp><speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
<p>This very night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
To night?
</p></sp><sp>
<speaker>Stalacta</speaker><p>
To night, in the Glen of Fire, but not as now.  Then a poor 
weak, fluttering, charm-encompassed bird, you snatched me 
from the jaws of death, broke the dark spell of transformation 
and gave to me the priceless boon of liberty.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Rodolphe</speaker><p>
I do remember.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
And so do I.  Phew! How the sparks flew when master smashed 
the head of the scaly monster, and such a smell of brimstone.  
I do believe it was one of the Beelzebub&#39;s own imps in disguise.

Ha, ha! Dancing&#39;s all very well in its way, but there&#39;s the

rogues hook the silly shiners.  Oh, if there&#39;s one thing in

another.  Oh I can&#39;t stand it any longer, fishing&#39;s like

drawn forth.</stage>

the margin of the water and draws forth a large crab which 
he places in the hand of Greppo.  It seizes him by the

I don&#39;t know about this.  Excuse me for asking the question,
but, as an unprejudiced observer, don&#39;t you think this

after it is violently seized and a frantic struggle 
ensues, during which he is nearly drawn overboard 
two or three times.  Suddenly an amphibeous monster 
springs from the water and pursues Greppo around, 
off, and on the stage, to the great delight of the 
Amphibea, Gnomes &amp; Fairies who indulge in boisterous 
laughter.  Greppo in his terror throws himself at the

And still as tough as Dame Gretchen&#39;s gander that was twenty one
last Easter.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
Why, Madame Barbara, I thought you enjoyed it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
So I do, child, so I do, particularly the masquerading.  One 
has so many pleasant things whispered in one&#39;s ear, but I 
can&#39;t say much for the waltzing--it&#39;s such a terrible 
thing to take the starch out of one&#39;s linen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>La, Madame Barbara, what&#39;s a little starch?  Nothing!
 If I waltzed as gracefully as you--
<stage>
(Barbara makes a gesture of satisfaction)</stage>
and had such an inviting waist
<stage>
(Barbara pinches her waist)</stage>
I&#39;d keep at it until I was as limp as a boiled cabbage leaf.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Then you--you think me graceful, eh?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
As a hippopotamus.
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
As a sylph.  You were the envy of all the ladies and the admiration 
of all the other sex.  Did you notice the courtly 
gentleman in the blue mask?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
He who danced so often with the lady Amina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes, madame.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And what of him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Nothing, only he was frantic to get an introduction to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
No was he?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed, Madame, and when his Lordship the count engaged 
the Lady Amina for a moment, he turned to me, and slipping 
a golden crown into my palm with one hand, pressing his heart 
with the other, and pointing to you with the other 
asked with a sweet, sighing silvery voice, 
trembling with emotion, who is that lovely being?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
No!  Did he?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed, Madame.
<stage>
(Aside)</stage>
The saints forgive me for lying.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
And Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, who overheard him, turned pea-green 
with jealousy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Fanning herself &amp; pressing her hand upon her heart)</stage>
Be still, little trembler, be still.  I declare, my silly 
heart is fluttering like a poor little starling in a gold 
cage.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
More like a big buzzard in a steel trap.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Carline, take my fan, child.
<stage>
(Gives it)</stage>
The exertion will make my complexion too ruddy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>So it will, Madame, and ruddy complexions are not genteel.
Allow <emph rend="underline">me</emph>.
<stage>(Fans her vigorously)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Not so violent, girl.  You&#39;ll disarrange my hair.  Gently, 
very gently, a sort of sportive zephyr.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>I understand, Madame.  
You want a mild sort of tickling sensation.
Something like one feels on one&#39;s neck when a gentleman 
whispers in one&#39;s ear.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Languidly)</stage>
Y-e-s.
<stage>(Sighs)</stage>
And he called me a-a-a-what did he call me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>A swan-like creature. </p>
<stage>
(Aside)</stage>
<p>A goose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh.<stage>
(Sighs)</stage>
Who can he be I wonder.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Nobody appears to know, exactly. I heard his Lordship the 
Count whisper to the Baron von Stuffencram that he suspected 
the mysterious blue mask to be no other than the young prince 
Leopold.  Once, while dancing, his domino came open at the 
breast and I saw a collar of jewels fit for an Emperor.  
Real dazzler that nearly blinded me.  However, 
as everybody is to unmask at the grand banuqet, we will 
then know all about him.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Eh, what, the Prince Leopold?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>So his lordship the Count thinks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Why he&#39;s already affianced, as everybody knows, 
to the young 
Princess Fredericka.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Dear me, so he is.  How unfortunate!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Poor young man, how I pity him.  What a terrible thing it is 
to be of royal blood and not have the liberty to choose for 
one&#39;s self.  Heigho!  I know it is a sad, cruel, wicked thing 
to blight a young and budding affection, but as the right 
honorable foster-mother that <emph rend="underline">is</emph> to be 
of her right honorable 
ladyship that is to be, I musn&#39;t encourage his highness in 
a hopeless passion.<stage>

(Entering from terrace L.H. Von Puffengruntz)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker>

There she is!  What a grace.  What a dignity.  What a walk.
<stage>(Coming foward L.H.)</stage>
Ah-a-a!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(Sighing)</stage>
There&#39;s another victim to love&#39;s cruel dart.  My fan, child.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Giving it)</stage>
Be careful, use it gently Madame; remember your complexion.
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
What a lovely couple--powder and puff.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p><stage>
(Aside)</stage>
What a golden opportunity.<stage>
(Aloud)</stage>
Young woman, as I left the grand hall I heard your mistress 
asking for you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><stage>(Aside)</stage>
<p>Of course, I understand, cunning old walrus. <stage>(Aloud)</stage> May I return, 
Madame?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Yes, but before you go you&#39;d better leave with me the--
the reviving draught.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><stage>(Aside)</stage>
<p>Reviving draught!--double distilled schnapps.</p>  
<stage>(Aloud)</stage>
<p>You&#39;ll find it in your pocket, Madam.  <delSpan>Don&#39;t you 
remember, </delSpan>I gave it to you as we entered the garden.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<stage>(Feeling in her pocket)</stage>
<p>Bless me, so you did.  What with the waltzing on one side and 
my conquests on the other, I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m standing 
on my heels or my head.  You can go!  <stage>
(Coquettes with her dress, etc.)
</stage></p></sp>
<delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
May I go now, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Yes, certainly child, that is if her ladyship requires you.
<stage>
(Coquettes with her dress, etc.)
</stage>
</p></sp>
</delSpan>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
I thought so, willing old pelican.  She&#39;s beginning to dress 
her feathers already.  Never mind, I shall have another flirtation 
with the Prince&#39;s equery, the drollest and most agreeable 
fellow in the world, and <emph>such</emph> a rogue.</p></sp>
<stage>
(Exit <del>terrace</del> L.H.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><stage>
(L.H.) gazes admiringly at her, and sighs.
</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p><stage>
(R.H.) casting sidelong glances at him)</stage>
Heigho!  There he is: My charms tonight have completed the 
conquest.  He&#39;s fast bound in the bonds of rosy cupid.  I see 
a proposal in one eye and a marriage settlement in the other. 
But I mustn&#39;t draw him in too suddenly.  These men are like 
trout, they must be played with a little.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Full moon of the festival, why have you so cruelly robbed 
the grand hall of your light, and left us to grope about in 
the dull glimmer of the sickly stars.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t talk to me about moonshine and sickly stars, you heartless, 
gay deceiver.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Deceiver!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Deceiver!  Didn&#39;t I see you gallivanting with the fraulein 
Von Skragneck, the new Burgomaster&#39;s daughter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Politeness, my dear Madame Barbara, merely politeness, on my 
honor.  The fact is I-I had the misfortune to tread on the 
lady&#39;s favorite bunion, and what you mistook for tenderness 
was only an apology<delSpan>--an apology, believe me, my dear Madame 
Barbara, only an apology.</delSpan>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, you men, you deceiving men, you are always ready with an 
excuse.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
On the honor of a Von Puffengruntz, I swear I speak the truth.
The fraulein Von Skragneck, indeed!  Haven&#39;t I got eyes?  Ah, 
cruel fair one, compared with her and all others, you are 
the stately sunflower in a meadow of dandelions.  As-as-as the 
queenly hollyhock in a garden of chickweed.

<stage>
Music ( )  Tremulo piano--Dragonfin ascends quickly 
through trap behind low set plant R.H. 2nd. Ent. He steps forward 
and listens.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
It&#39;s coming at last, I know it&#39;s coming.<stage>
(pressing her heart)</stage>
What a strange flutter.  I hope I&#39;m not going to faint.  Dear 
me, what poor, weak silly creatures we are.  I must nerve myself 
for the trying occasion.  How fortunate <del>it is that</del> I happen 
to have my smelling salts about me.<stage>
(Draws flask from his pocket, turns back to Von Puff 
and drinks)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
She&#39;s moved.  She&#39;s overcome with emotion, she turns to hide 
her blushes.  She yields, and now, like a conqueror, I&#39;ll 
gather in the fruits of victory.</p></sp>
<stage>(He kneels with difficulty at the feet of Barbara, his 
face half-averted, and is about to take her hand when
Dragonfin glides quietly between them, extends 
his left hand to Von Puffengruntz and takes Barbara&#39;s 
in the other.  (They both sigh)</stage>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker>
<stage>
(Squeezing the hand of Dragonfin who shakes with suppressed 
laughter)</stage>
<p>Poor, frightened thing, how she trembles.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Dear me, how strangely the tender passion affects him.  He&#39;s 
shaking like an aspen and his hand is as cold as ice.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Bewitching syren, listen to the voice of love.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, how can you--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
Don&#39;t call me Von Puffengruntz, call be Maximillian, call me 
<emph> your</emph> Maximillian.
<stage>(Squeezes Dragonfin&#39;s hand; Dragonfin squeezes Barbara&#39;s)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Oh, don&#39;t, you naughty man, you--you hurt my hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Von Puff</speaker><p>
No, did I?  Queen of Love and Beauty, then let me heal the 
bruise.
<stage>(Kisses the hand of Dragonfin rapturously who, at the 
same time, kisses Barbara&#39;s)</stage>
And now that I&#39;ve healed it let me call it mine.  
<stage>(Looks for the first time attentively at the hand, 
continues inspection up the arm until he encounters 
the grinning face of Dragonfin, when in speechless 
terror he drops the hand, makes various floundering 
attempts to regain his feet, and finally exits hurriedly L.H. 1st Ent.)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<p>Shall I keep him a little longer with Cupid&#39;s dart sticking 
in his bosom, or shall I end his misery.</p>

<p>Ahem, you&#39;ll-you&#39;ll never be a naughty boy again?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dragonfin</speaker>

(squeezes her hand)</stage>
</sp>

<stage>(Entering R.H. 1st Ent. hurriedly &amp; disturbed.)</stage>
Foiled, tricked, crossed in the hour of my victory.  A life 
desperately played for and fairly won, snatched from the jaws 
of death.  He lives, my chosen victim lives, and flushed with 
triumph and vast hoards of gold, stalks boldly forth to mock 
me.  Oh, curse the interposing power the stepped between us.  
A withering palsy light upon her arm, and blight and pestilence 
infect the air she breathes!  Oh impotent--oh, driveling 
fool!  To work, to work!  A soul once tampered with must 
be pursued, not cast aside to tempt another.  So runs the bond 
to which I&#39;ve sealed.  &#39;Tis well, &#39;tis well.  I&#39;ll track him 
as the sleuth hound tracks the stag.  He must be, shall be 
mine!</p></sp>

</stage>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>No, no, Master Equerry, that won&#39;t do.  You are very clever, 
very droll and you tell very funny stories, but that last 
joke is a trifle too much.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
But my dear Susetta--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p><stage>(Laughing)</stage>
There, there.  I knew you were not in earnest.  My name&#39;s 
not Susetta.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Of course it isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s- it&#39;s- what is it?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>No it isn&#39;t &quot;What is it,&quot; It&#39;s Carline.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Of course it is, but you see I always mean Carline when I 
say Suesetta.  Therefore Susetta--that is my dear Carline, when
I tell you I love you--
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>(laughing)
I don&#39;t believe a word you say.  Why you arrived here scarely 
three hours ago, and you&#39;ve already been making love to half 
the girls in the castle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
It&#39;s a mistake, my dear Susetta--I mean Carline, altogether 
a mistake.  I had my eye on you from the first, and any little 
outside pleasantry you may have happened to notice were only 
to get my hand in.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>And this is only to <emph>keep</emph> it in, I suppose.  
No, no.  I&#39;m not as simple as I look, and I tell you, 
clever master Equerry, 
it won&#39;t do.  
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
But my dear Carline, allow me to tell you that I&#39;m <emph>not</emph> an 
equerry.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>No?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>No.
<stage>
(Drawing himself up)</stage>
I&#39;m consulting secretary, confidential adviser, Portable 
treasury, and principal disbursing officer to his highness 
the Prince.
<stage>
(Aside)
</stage>
Everybody takes master to be a Prince and it&#39;s no part of my 
business to undeceive them.  Besides if he isn&#39;t a Prince 
he deserves to be, and I ought to be his Prime Minister.

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Yes!

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
No, have I?  Permit me to return it to you.
<stage>(Kisses her)</stage>
Now listen, my dear little Carline, I have a secret and as 
there should be no secrets between man and wife--that is, 
man and wife that <emph>are</emph> to be, 
I&#39;m going to share it with you.

<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>A secret, dear Greppo?

<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Oh, thank you.  You needn&#39;t repeat it again at present.

as much as I can stand &#39;till I get used to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Well, then, the secret.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
Yes.  In the first place, do you love your mistress, Carline?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Love her?  I&#39;d die for her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
No, no, no, no.  I don&#39;t want you to go quite so far as that.
I&#39;m not ambitious to be a widower before I&#39;ve had my 
honeymoon.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Well, then, I love her dearly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
That&#39;s better.  And she loves my mas--that is this young Rodolphe, 
the painter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Better than her own life, poor dear lady.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Greppo</speaker><p>
And would marry him but for this ruffianly Count Wolfenstein?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>Yes--but the secret.

make of themselves--but I can&#39;t say I enjoy the waltzing.--it&#39;s 
ruinous to a delicate complexion--is my face much flushed child?
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
La!  Madame Barbara!  You are only improved by a little heightened color.--for 
my part I wouldn't mind being red as a peony if I could move through the dance 
as gracefully as you do.

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>

<p>I am more than ever persuaded Carline is a very sensible 
girl!  <stage>(aloud)</stage> do you think me graceful child?

What I think Madame Barbara signifies little; <del>what</del>

<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>

<p>Oh fie!  For shame Carline!--You mustn&#39;t tell me of such 
things--what young gentlemen?

<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>
He in the blue domino for instance--he who is, they say 
a Prince--I wonder if he is...I couldn&#39;t see his face--
but he has a way with him that makes me think I have 
seen him before.--however he has been following you all the evening--
<stage>(aside)</stage> while the Lady Amina was under your wing.
</p>
</sp> 
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>I remarked his assiduities child, and got rid of him by a 
stratagem--I requested him to dance with my daughter Amina.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>That was a clever trick Madame.--I warrant me he 
consented readily enough--how cunningly you escape him 
Madame Barbara.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
 From a sense of duty, child!  I don&#39;t wish to make Herr 
 Von Puffengruntz jealous you know. 
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>
Bless me!  I think there's no amusement equal to making a lover jealous.--
I am going to try how it succeeds with mine.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Thoughtless and impudent girl!  You don&#39; mean to say you have a lover 
at your age?
</p></sp>
 <sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Oh!  Please Madame Barbara, don&#39; be angry with me he only loves me a very 
little bit.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And who is this moderate lover pray?
</p></sp>
 <sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>Young Casper, who guides travelers across the Brocken.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
And why do you wish to make him jealous?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker><p>
Because I caught him kissing Susette--I&#39;ll let him see that two 
can play at that game.  There&#39;s that handsome young man, the 
Equerry to the Prince, at least we suppose he is a Prince, he has been 
plaguing me all the evening,--such a beautiful dancer--he waltzes like a 
humming top!
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Barbara</speaker><p>
Well take care his waltzing doesn&#39;t turn your silly little head!--
I declare here are my daughter Amina and the Stranger Prince again--
I must fly!</p>

<stage>Exit R.H.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Carline</speaker>

Your story is indeed most wondrous.  But on, dear Rodolphe,

Fear not, I will defend my right with my life.  The same kind

still.  You shall be saved.  All is ready for our flight.

swift horses are concealed.  After midnight the moon

<p>
Alas that things ever fall so ill.  &#39;Tis now six months 
since that never-to-be-forgotten night, and still no news 
of the lost mistress of Wolfenstein.  Nor yet of his Lordship, 
who has sworn a dreadful oath never to return to the castle until 
he has brought her back and revenged himself on the horrible 
monster who has stolen her.  And that graceless baggage Carline, 
too, to go off at the same time, leaving all the cares 
of the household to fall on <emph>my</emph> poor shoulders.  
And then to make matters worse, spells and witchcraft turn all 
things upside down.  The cows milk vinegar, the wells are dry, the 
hens lay addled eggs---

And all the wine&#39;s turned sour.

<stage>(Looking ruefully at him)</stage>
There&#39;s another comfort.  To think that I, the right honorable 
foster-mother that <emph>was</emph> to have been to her right 
honorable Ladyship that was to have been--for whom many a young and 
tender heart has sighed in vain--should ever have thrown herself 
away upon a wine-butt.

<stage>(Hic)</stage>  A wine-butt, Madam Von Puffengruntz?
