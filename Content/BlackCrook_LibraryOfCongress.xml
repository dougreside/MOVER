<head> Act 1.</head>

<head> Scene I -- </head>
<stage> A quiet valley at the foot of the Hartz Mountains; Cottage of Dame Barbara, R. H. 3rd Ent.
	with practicable upper window and balcony ; Set tree beside cottages, at back ; set arbor
	L.H. 3rd ent., broken water and low rustic stone bridge or long tailpiece with platform,
	from R to L, backed by an extended range of distant hills or mountain spurs, above which
	light clouds appear, illuminated by the reflected light of the moon. Shortly after rise of
	curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over
	the clouds and horizon. MUSIC. At rise of curtain--enter Rodolphe at back R. H. he
	descends, comes forward, and after looking cautiously around claps his hands three times
	beneath the window and conceals himself in the arbor. The upper window opens and Amina
	appears on balcony.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Surely I heard his well-known signal. Hist! who's there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [appearing,]</stage> Tis I, Rodolphe. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Rodolphe! Hush, speak low, if my foster-mother still sleeps, I will join you.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [Retires.] [Music.] RODOLPHE goes up stage and looks cautiously off, then comes
down. Amina enters from cottage.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Throwing herself into his arms,]</stage> Rodolphe! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> My own! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> When did you return? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> 'Twas past midnight ; although wearied and footsore I could not sleep until I had seen
	you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Oh, how wearily the days and nights have passed since you left me. What kept you so
long? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Ill fortune, Amina. After reaching Gottingen, and finding no purchaser for my
picture, I heard that there was a wealthy traveller at Cassel, collecting works
of art, I had but four silver florins in my pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet
him. After journeying five whole days I arrived at Cassel only to find that the
traveller had departed two days before. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> And your beautiful picture, upon which so much of our future was built, you have
brought it back. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> No ; crushed in my last hope to obtain the means necessary to our union, I left it with a
	remorseless agent for a pittance barely sufficient for subsistence during my journey
	homeward, and here I am without a single guilder in my pocket, and what is worse, if I fail to
	redeem my pledge at the end of two months it is lost to me forever. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Aside.]</stage> Poor, dear, Rodolphe, he knows not the worst, the
heaviest blow is yet to come, how shall I break it to him ;
<stage> [aloud,]</stage> Dear Rodolphe, my great joy at seeing you made me
forget for a moment that which I fear to tell you.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [The moonlight begins to fade and the horizon grows ruddy with the rising sun]
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Fear to tell me ; speak, what has happened. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Be calm and Listen. Last week I attended the festival of St. John in company with the
other members of the village choir, upon raising my eyes after we had finished the
anthem, I found a dark, strange man gazing upon me ; a moment after he quitted the
spot. I inquired who he was, and learned that he was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain. </p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Well. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Although I met his gaze but for a moment, I felt that it boded evil to me...to us. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Evil! Evil to us! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears idle; the next day brought him here, to our
humble abode. He told my foster-mother that he loved me. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Starting.]</stage> Loved! you? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in obscurity, that we should be removed to
the castle, that masters should be provided for my suitable education, and in a
year I should take the place of the late Countess of Wolfenstein. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> And Dame Barbara--- </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Joyfully consented. This very day is set apart for our removal. The escort will be
here at sunrise. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> And you, Amina, you!--- </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> I supplicated, wept, remonstrated, but you know, dear Rodolphe, I am powerless.
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Vehemently]</stage> By heaven, you shall not go! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> Hush, be calm, dear Rodolphe.
	<stage>[DAME BARBARA appears on balcony.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> I say you shall not! Were he twenty times more potent I would oppose his power to the
last. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Eh, what, varlet, hussey, only wait till I get down.
<stage> [Music. She disappears from Balcony and enters from door.]</stage>
What, jade, ingrate, how dare you! Is this your gratitude! Where is your pride!
You the most noble Countess of Wolfenstein that is to be, meeting young men in
secret and on the very day of your bethrothal! Oh, if his high mightiness the
Count should find it out! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amina</speaker>
<p> But mother-- </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Not a world, how dare you; in with you, into the house, in I say!</p>
<stage> [Forces her into the cottage, closes the door, then turns to
Rodolphe.]</stage><p> So, beggar, you've come back, have you! How dare you
show your unlucky face here at such a time as this! I had hoped you'd fallen into the
hands of the conscript officers and gone for a soldier, or better still, been
carried off by the Demons of the Brocken. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> And yet, as you see, I've escaped both. Hark ye, Dame. I love Amina, she loves me, you
yourself promised that she should be mine as soon as I could command a hundred
silver crowns. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Bah, that was before I knew her value, but now that I do know it and others know it too,
I've changed my mind. But where are the hundred crowns ; where's the fortune you
were to get for your great painting! I warrant me you havn't got a single groschen
of it. Come, let me see the hundred crowns. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> My picture is not yet sold. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Ha, ha! Did I not say so! Not yet sold! Here is a pretty fellow that would take a young girl from
	her comfortable home, a good bed, sweet milk and egg pudding, to lodge her on pea straw, and
	feed her at best on black bread and sour cheese. Oh, was there ever such villainy! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Nay, but listen to me. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Not a word, begone. Do you think people of quality have nothing to do but listen to
beggars complaints, and above all at such a time as this. Begone, I say, this is to
be a festival day, the maidens of the village will be here anon, the grand escort
will be here headed by the Count's chamberlain, aye, and his lordship the Count
himself will be here to bear the Countess that is to be and her right honorable
foster-mother that is to be to the castle.
<stage> [Music.]</stage> Hark, here come the villagers already, out of the way,
I say!
<stage> [Pushes him rudely aside, goes up and looks off R. H. Rodolphe retires
into the arbor.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<stage> [Enter lively, from R. H. at back female villagers, with garlands, followed by
males bearing a rustic chair festooned with flowers, they descend and come forward,
greetiag the Dame, females L. H. males R. at back. The sun appears above one of the
spurs.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Ah, you are early friends. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Yes, but not earlier than the sun, for see, it is already peeping over the great toe
of the Brocken. But where's Amina? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Drawing herself up.]</stage> The Countess that is to be is preparing to
receive his lordship the Count, but never mind her ladyship. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Bliss me, how grand Dame Barbara has grown to be sure. If she goes on at this rate the
wide halls of the grand old castle of Wolfenstein will be a world too small to hold
her. I hope this piece of good fortune will not make such a fool of dear 'Mina</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosetta </speaker>
<p> I don't understand this. I thought 'Mina was bethrothed to the handsome young painter
	Rodolphe ; whatever could have become of him? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Oh, 'tis said he has gone for a soldier. But come, while 'Mina is making ready let us
rehearse our Festival Dance.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [Music. Grand Garland Dance by principals and full Ballet, during which the males
gather around the table and eat and drink. After dance Barbara re-enters,
extravagantly dressed, wearing a monstrous cap, ridiculously trimmed </stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> There, having compleed her ladyships toilet, I have attended to my own, and if I
know anything about dress I flatter myself that my appearance would do honor to
any occasion. </p>
</sp>
<stage> [Displays herself.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Aside to Rosetta.]</stage> Mercy on us, was there ever such a fright!
Why, she looks for all the world like a great horned owl, dressed up in the cast-off
finery of a peacock. Ha, ha ha! did you ever! Observe me tickle the old buzzard.
<stage> [Aloud and with affected admiration.]</stage> Why, Dame Barbara ! is
that you? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Drawing herself up.] </stage> Of course it is, child ; who else should it
be!
<stage> [Aside.]</stage> I knew I should make them open their eyes. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Why, you've almost taken away my breath! I declare Dame, you're looking gorgeous ;
so young and girlish, too, indeed, if I were 'Mina--I beg pardon, I mean her
ladyship--I wouldn't care to have her in the way when his lordship the Count
arrives. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> And why not, pray? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Because I should consider you a dangerous rival. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Nonesense, girl, you don't think so. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carline</speaker>
<p> Indeed, Dame Barbara, I was never more serious in my life.
<stage> [Laughingly confers with Rosetta &amp; villagers.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> It is strange I never noticed it before, but that girl Carline is a very sensible
person.
<stage> [MUSIC]</stage> Ah, here comes the escort.
<stage> [All go up and look off R. H.--RODOLPHE glides from the arbor into the
cottage, unobserved.]</stage>
<stage> [ENTER from R. H. and crossing the bridge, VON PUFFENGRUNTZ, bearing
the wand of office, preceeded by two servants of the Count's household, as he
comes down the male villagers take off their caps, and the females
courtsey.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (L. H.) [With pompous consideration] </stage> Be covered, good people,
be covered, the air of the valley is yet damp, we never insist upon ceremony at the
expense of health.
<stage> [Aside]</stage> Ahem! It is the true policy of greatness to
occasionally waive a point of etiquette on dealing with inferiors. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> What a courtly gentleman! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> What an imposing female! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (Courtseying)</stage> Your Excellency is welcome. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> (Bowing) I cannot be mistaken. I was just about to inquire, but that stately
presence and graceful dignity tell me that I am addressing Madam Barbara. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (Curtseying)</stage> Oh, sir,
<stage> [aside]</stage> How one's manner will betray one. I always said I
belonged to a higher sphere. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> I come, Madam, by the Count's order, to announce that the cavalcade has arrived and
is now resting on the plateau beyond the ravine. His lordship will be here
presently, and in person conduct your fair foster-daughter to her palfrey that
waits without, impatient for the honor to be mounted by her. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Courtseying]</stage> Oh, sir, his lordship is so considerate. But,
may I inquire if I have been thought of? And I, also to be provided with a becoming
escort? Is there any palfrey without impatient for the honor to be ridden by me?
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> That shall be my privilege. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Astonished.]</stage> Eh! </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> That is, I have charged myself with the especial happiness of being your escort. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Courtseying very low.]</stage> Oh!
<stage> [Music]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> He comes! Room there for his lordship!
<stage> [Villagers range themselves to receive the Count, who enters R. H.
crosses the bridge, preceded by guards and followed by Wulgar and Bruno.
When down L. H. villagers shout and wave their caps.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> Salutation to the good Dame Barbara. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Courtesying very low]</stage> Oh, your lordship. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> And how fares your lovely charge? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Well, may it please your lordship, quite well, a little nervous from over anxiety
to see your lordship, but that's quite natural with us poor silly things. I
suffered dreadfully in that way when my poor dear, dead and gone Christopher
courted me, many and many a time--- </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Interrupting her]</stage> But the fair Amina. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> Is quite ready and dying to see you. I will present her to your lordship at once.
<stage> [She is going into the cottage when Rodolphe appears and comes forward,
leading Amina by the hand. Chord.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Allow me, Dame Barbara, to do the honors. Vil. Rodolphe!
<stage> [Picture of astonishment.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> My lord Count Wolfenstein, permit me, Rodolphe Werner, a poor artist, to present to you
	Amina, foster-daughter to Dame Barbara--a free maiden of the valley and my affianced
	bride. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> Who is this madman? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p> N-n-n-n-nobody, your lordship, that is, a poor, weak simpleton who imagines he is
betrothed to every girl in the village--as your lordship truly says, a madman.
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p> A madman! mercy on us, we shall all be murdered ! Seize him, secure him, somebody,
everybody.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [MUSIC. Wulfgar and Bruno seize Rodolphe, and after a struggle overpower him.
Amina screams and throws herself at the Count's feet ; he raises and passes her to Bar-
bara, then turns to guards. </stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> Release him.
<stage> [They release him.]</stage> His misfortune claims our pity. Let some
of his fellows conduct him hence, and see that no harm comes to him. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> My Lord Count!-- [Defiantly </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> Begone, sirrah!</p></sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Casper</speaker>
		<p>Come, Rodolphe, come with me.</p>
		<stage> [Aside.]</stage>
		<p>Are you indeed mad to brave the tiger in his lair.
		<stage> [Leads him R. H.]</stage>, I say, this is neither time nor place to right your
		wrong. Be calm, I say, be calm.</p> </sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Shaking his hand]</stage> You are right, Casper, you are right.
<stage> [Looks scornfully at Wolfenstein.]</stage> Come, my friend, come.
<stage> [Exit R. H. 1st ent. with Casper.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Aside.]</stage> 'Tis he, the lover. He braves me, too.
<stage> [Aloud.]</stage> Wulgar!
<stage> [Wulfgar advances. Apart to him.]</stage> Track younder knave ; take
Bruno with you ; seize him, but let no eye see you ; place him in the secret vault
beneath the eastern wing ; once there, you know the rest. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wulfgar</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Nods meaningly.]</stage> I understand.
<stage> [Gives a sign to Bruno, and is going R. H., 1st ent.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wolfenstein</speaker>
<p> Stay, not now, it will be noted. When the procession moves, then steal away by the upper path.
	<stage> [Wulfgar nods, turns upstage and confers with Bruno. Wolfenstein confers with
		Von Puffengruntz at back.]</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
<p>
	<stage> [Leading Amina forward, and aside to her.]</stage> Silence, on your life; not a
	word that you have ever seen him before. If the Count were to know---Mercy on me, I tremble to
	think of it--there wouldn't be a head left on any of our shoulders.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [Birds are heard singing till scene closes.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
<p>
<stage> [Waving his wand]</stage> Let the procession move.</p>
</sp>
<stage> [Music. Wolfenstein joins Amina. Villagers bring forward the festooned chair
from L. H. N. E.; Wolfenstein assists Amina into the seat ; the chair is borne by four
villagers ; the others form in procession, Wolfenstein beside the chair, Von
Puffengruntz pompously leading Barbara by the hand ; Wulfgar and Bruno loiter be-
hind and when unobserved steal off R. H. N. E.; the procession after making the circuit
of the stage, ascends the rocks L. H. and crosses R., the Villagers singing the
following </stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CHORUS:</speaker>
<lg>

<l> Hark! hark! hark!</l>
<l> Hark! the birds with tuneful voices,</l>
<l> Vocal for our lady fair,</l>

<p> Aye, if, but he'll not. I watched him from behind "The Devil's Hump," and saw him
part company with that lout at the foot of the old cross. I tell you his path lies
this way.

some horrible dream ? Water, water ; my throat is flaming. Ha ! yonder is a rill
trickling from the rock.</p>

		<p> Vain, vain! Some subtle spell is hovering in the air that mocks my power and makes
			the charms that once were potent a gibbering, idle sound. And shall I yield to this
			Invisible? I, Hertzog the Crook, whom men call sorcerer ; I, at whose name the
			strong man trembles and the weak grows faint ; I, whose whole life of long,
			laborious years hath well nigh run its course gleaning dark knowledge in
			forbidden paths--shall I now seek the light? My eyes are old and weak, and could
			not brave the glare. No, no, I'll work new mines, new mines, and plumb the depths of
			darker mysteries still.

and shakes like a great ship at sea.  [Loud thunder.]  Mercy 
on us, what a crash!  But, pshaw!  why should I care how 
the tempest rages without ?  am I not safe within, and in rare 
good luck, too?  Only to think that I should be chosen from 
among all the girls in the village to become Amina's com-
panion and own particular waiting maid!  Old Hagar, the 
Gipsy fortune-teller, whose palm I crossed with a new quar-
ter florin last week, at the festival, told me that good fortune 
awaited me, and, sure enough, here it is.  Only to think of 
it, that I, Carline Brenner, who for ten long years have been 
chained to a stupid spinning-wheel, day and night, should 
become confidential companion to the future mistress of 
Wolfenstein.  Was there ever such good fortune ?  I de-

ing over a rock five feet high R. H. 3d ent., with set blasted tree ; 
large working raven on limb, and vampyre doors in trunks.  Set rock
piece in C. on stage opposite 2d grooves, bearing a general resemblance
in outline to a rude altar.  Set trick plants with serrated leaves R. 
and L.  Set small rock pieces R. and L. (in 1.)  The whole stage is 
much broken up with rocky sets, leaving the center, back of the altar, 
generally open.  Lights down.  Music at opening.  HERTZOG ap-
pears above L. H., followed by GREPPO tremblingly.  They cross 
from L. to R.. re-cross on rock in front of blasted tree and descend 
slowly ; GREPPO, making several efforts to turn back, is checked by 
a gesture from HERTZOG.</stage>

what a place.  [Music.  The raven croaks, flaps its wings

Thank St. Michael, I'm rid of that pleasant companion.  
As I have an empty belly, and hope some day to have it 
filled, I could swear before the Burgomaster that when we 
passed over the bridge of Belzebub's Nose, I heard voices 
laughing inside that very casket, saw blue blazes come out of 
the keyhole, and smelt a strong smell of brimstone.  [Music.  
The raven croaks as before.  Looking fearfully around.]
Oh, Lord!  oh, Lord! what a pleasant place for an uninter-
rupted funeral.  Ugh!

  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>   I obey.  [Aside.]  Here's a chance ; if I can only 
get out of this, may the fiend singe me if he catches me 
back.  I'd rather be in the raging flood again than serve 
him an hour longer.  [Is about to ascend the rocks.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>   Whither go you, varlet?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>   For fuel, master ; this around us is wet with the 
storm and will not burn.  As we came along I noted, be-
neath the shelter of a crag hard by, many dry faggots.  I 
will fetch them.  [Going

    three times with crutch stick.  Blue flame issues from the 
top and continues during the scene.

  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>  [Starting.]  A flame!  How came we by a flame?  
I'll swear I brought no tinder-box.  More brimstone, I sup-
pose.  Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!

  ery.

plant.  [Points to plant L. H.

    proaches the plant L. H., and is about to pluck a leaf,
    when it opens suddenly and discovers a dwarf demon, 
    around whose body is twined a huge green serpent, with 
    flaming eyes, distended jaws and forked tounge.  As the 
    leaves open, the head darts at Greppo threateningly.  He 
    starts back, uttering a cry of alarm.  The leaves close.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>   Ha!  [Stamps his foot angrily, and points to the 
    plant R. H..  Greppo tremblingly crosses to R. H., and is 
about to pluck a leaf from the plant, when it opens, and 
the same action of the dwarf, demon, serpent and Greppo
as before.  Leaves close.

from yonder casket.  [Music.  Grepppo goes to the casket L. 
     H. and raises the lid, when fire flashes from the box.  He 
     starts back in an agony of fright, and crossing, sits upon 
     the small set rock piece R. H. 1st ent., when flames shoot 
     from the stone, and he springs into the air, uttering a 
     sharp cry of pain.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  [Enraged.]  Baffled at every turn!  Begone, knave, 
thy presence mars my work. 
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>  Most willingly.  [Is about to ascend the rocks.
</p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>   Not there.  [Greppo groans and returns.]  Keep 
watch without from yonger crag that overhangs the gorge.
[Points R. H. 1st ent.]  Should stragging footsteps bend this 
way, give timely warning.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>   [Aside.]  Straggling footsteps!  straggling, indeed, 
to be abroad on such a night, and least of all in such a place 
as this.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  Didst hear me?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>  I vansih.  [Exit R. H. 1st ent.
  [Music.  Hertzog describes a circle and figures on the 
  ground (C) with his crutch stick, after which the end of 
  the stick ignites and burns with a faint blue flame.  He 
  then describes figures in the air, during which latter
  action he speaks.]

thee.

  [Music.  A spectre in filmy drapery, with Death's head, 
luminous eyes, moveable jaw and skeleton hands works on 
from R. H. N. E. to C.  Illuminated by light from medium.]

  Skul. Your will.

  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  Break the malignant spells that thwart and mock 
me.  Bind fast my hidden enemies.  Restore to me my lost 
power.

  Skul. I cannot.  An adverse spell has crossed me;  my power is 
spent.  All that was mine is thine.  Zamiel alone 
can serve thee.

  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  [Shrinking.]  Zamiel?

  Skul. Zamiel.  Dismiss me.

welp glides off L. H.]

My blood grows icy cold, my limbs are failing, a film is 
gathering in my eyes. [Falls C.]  Can this be death?  
Death!  No, no.  I cannot, I will not die!  Save me, save

 denly appears from trunk of blasted tree, with strong 
 light from red medium thrown upon him.  He holds 
 the picture a moment before speaking.  Hertzog 
 kneeling down, L. H. Music ceases.
</stage>  
 </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  Arise! [Hertzog rises.] Why am I summoned?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  My life is waining.  Give me to live ; feed the dull 
current of my sluggish veins ; give me fresh charms and 
potencies.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  Wherefore?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>   Men hate, and, did they not fear, would despise me.  I would repay their hate with hate ; I would live on, on, on
and in that life rival thy dread power of evil.
  </p> </sp> 
<sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  What wilt thou give for such a boon?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  Whate'er thou wilt.  Give me but life, and all I 
have is thine.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  'Tis not enough ; what's thine is mine already.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  What else?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  Listen.  A soul--younger, fresher, whiter than 
thine--must on each recurring year, be, by thy arts, turned 
to my account.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  I hear, dread master, and will pay the price.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  For every soul thus lost to good and gained to me, a 
year's new life is thine.  A single soul, a single year; a hun-
dred souls, a hundred years.  'Tis with thyself to live forever!
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  Forever?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Zamiel</speaker> <p>  Forever.  But should the stroke of midnight fall a 
twelvemonth hence, and no lost soul by you betrayed within 
that time come wailing at my gates, perdition closes on 
your dark career.  Is't a compact?
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  It is.</p> </sp>

   ning.  A fiend, Redglare, rises at Hertzog's elbow 
   through trap L. H., bearing a large red book, 
   pen and inkhorn.

	<head> ACT TWO</head>
	
	<head> Scene 1.--</head>
	<stage> A subterranean vault beneath the castle of Wolfenstein (in 2.) Set door R. H. N.
		E., moveable panel in upper part of R. H. flat ; sliding stone panel in lower part of L. H.
		flat. Wulfgar discovered chaining Rodolphe to wall of R. H. flat. Music at rise of
		curtain. Lights half down.</stage>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Wulfgar</speaker>
		<p> There, my fine fellow, I think you're both safe and comfortable. No intrusion;
			neither light nor sound, ever come here. This should have been your lodging last
			night, but you see I mislaid the key.</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Wretch. Wulfgar When you want exercise or change of air, and you can manage to get
			rid of yonder little encumbrances [pointing to chains], you can take it in the
			vault beneath your feet. Yonder trap leads to it. You may find it a little mouldy,
			and may stumble over the skeleton of the last lodger. But that's nothing ; any
			change is better than no change at all. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Monster, begone. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Wulfgar</speaker>
		<stage>[Taking up lamp.] </stage>
		<p>Oh certainly--anything to oblige. In the meantime, if your exercise should give
			you an appetite, and you should want food and water, cry out for it-cry loud and it
			won't come. Ha, ha ha! Good night.</p>
		<stage>[Exits R. H. door. Lights down.</stage></sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Alone! So ends in darkness and in death all my bright dreams of the future. And must I
			perish thus--I, who have but entered the portal of life? No, no, it cannot be. I
			must, I will burst these bonds.
			<stage>[Music. He makes an effort to break the chains.]</stage> 'Tis vain, they
			defy even the strength of despair.
			<stage> [Shuddering.]</stage> How awful is the chill of this noxious vault; its
			very vapors press upon my brow like the clammy hand of death, and freeze my very
			marrow. </p>
	</sp>
	<stage> [Music. Hertzog enters with dark lantern through sliding panel on L.H.
		flat.</stage>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Starting.] Who's there? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Thy friend. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Who are you? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> [Turning the light of the latern upon his own face.] Behold! [Chord </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Starting.] Hertzog, the Crook! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Aye, so men call me. [Puts lantern off L. H. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Ill-omened bird, what brings you here? Yet why should I ask? You come the minister
			of Death. 'Tis well, 'tis merciful--begin your work. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Out, foolish boy. I serve no human master. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Then why are you here? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> I come to give thee liberty. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Liberty? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Aye. Listen. I hate thine enemy. Thou lov'st a maid of whom thou hast been robbed.
			Would'st win her back? I have the power to aid thee. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Begone, tempter. I know your power, and can guess from whence it comes. Men say you
			deal in dark and necromantic spells that warp the senses and enthrall the soul.
			</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Bah! Art thou, too, tainted with the vulgar fear that calls philosophy-the
			natural working of great nature's laws- a spell of darkness? It is the light, weak
			boy, the light, which we sage men who waste our lives oe'r midnight lamps, glean
			from dull vapors for sluggards' use. Fools sneer the most when least they
			understand, and brand as foul what Nature stamps as fair. Thy gains gall thee; let
			me loose them. [He touches them with his staff; they fall to the ground. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Surprised.] What is your purpose? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Again I say, to serve thee. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> How? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Listen. I will tell thee a seceret. She whom thou lovest is of noble birth.</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rud.</speaker>
		<p> Amina?</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Aye; yet not Amina, but the only child and heiress of the noble house of
			Wellenstein--stolen when but an infant by a revengeful Gipsy whom her father
			scourged, and given to gabbling Barbara. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Amina noble? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Aye, and thou of humble birth. But gold can buy nobility ; nay, more, can give thee
			power to cross thine enemy. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Why talk to me of gold?--to me, the poorest of the poor, whose purse contains not
			half so much as one poor silver mark. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Thou'rt poor, indeed ; but thou art poor because thou wilt be poor. 'Tis with
			thyself to shame the wealth of mighty Croesus. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> How? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Hast thou not heard of glittering gold in massive piles fast locked within these
			mountains? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> An idle tale ; a senseless fable told by croning gossips ; a treasure often sought,
			but never found ; and some do say 'tis death to seek it. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> I tell thee, boy, the story's true ; this gold is palpable to sight and touch, and
			may be garnered, too, if thou art bold enough. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> I'll hear no more! Thou'dst take advantage of my desperate strait to work some
			juggle to entrap my soul. Begone I say, begone! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> And leave thee to thy doom? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Aye. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> And thy affianced bride--would'st thou so like a craven yield her up onto thine
			enemy? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Oh, agony! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> 'Tis true she loves thee ; but bethink thee, boy, she is but woman, and she may be won.
			Her noble birth is known to Wolfenstein, who means to wed her, and with her fortune
			prop his falling house. Already, flattered by his serpent tounge, she dries her
			tears and listens to his suit. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> 'Tis false! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> 'Tis true! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> The proof? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Behold! [Music. He waves his staff; a panel slides in upper part of R. H. flat,
			showing through gauze Wolfenstein and Amina, the former clasping the hand and
			kneeling at the feet of the latter, whose face is half averted. Picture strongly
			lighted. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Starting toward it.] By Heaven ! he shall not. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> [Interposing, waves his staff ; panel closes] Bravely said, bravely said. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Turning quickly.] What devilish compact would you have me sign? Propose it while
			my reason whirls and desperation aids your dam'd design. If by the act I snatch her
			from his grasp, I'll pay the ransom though it reach my soul. [Hertzog, with face
			averted chuckles sardonically.] Come, philosopher or fiend, whate'er thou
			art--the price, I say, the price. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Bah! I ask no compact. I would serve thee gratis. I but demand that thou shalt serve
			thyself. Be rich and thou'lt be powerful. In thy revenge upon thine enemy and mine
			thou'lt pay thy debt to me with interest. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Where lies this wondrous treasure? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Listen. Amid the fastnesses of the Hartz, beyond the outlet of the Black Gorge lies
			a small lake, whose waters few have ever gazen upon, for vulgare fear and
			superstitious dread have long since marked it for enchanted ground. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> I've heard the story. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Trace carefully its northern shore until a rock, rising like a wall, bars further
			passage. Beneath a fringe of tangled vines you'll find a boat concealed. Behold
			this talisman ring, [takes a large ring from his finger.] 'Tis a magnet of
			wondrous power. When thou hast found the boat step boldly in, this ring will guide
			the [sic] safely to the entrance of the goldern cavern, within the compass of
			whose glittering walls thy wondering eyes may feast on wealth far greater than
			the coffers of the world can boast. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Give me the ring. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> 'Tis thine! [gives it.] Stay, thou'lt need a henchman, [stamps his foot.] Varlet,
			come forth. [Panel on L. H. flat slides, as before, and Greppo enters, [aside]. He
			too shall perish. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
		<p> You're [sic] will, master? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> To part with three. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
		<p> [Aside.] Oh, if this should be true, [aloud] With me! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> With thee, knave. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
		<p> Wherefore? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> I weary with thine appetite. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
		<p> (Aside) Here's a chance! Oh here a chance, if he but stick to it. I must seem
			unwilling lest he repent, [aloud], Dear master, I will reform, believe me, I will
			reform, allowance me to what will starve a mouse, nay, more, to pleasure you, I
			will not eat at all. I'll live on air, but do not cast me off. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> I am resolved. Behold thy future master, [to Rodolphe.] Thou'lt find him faithful
			but he breeds a famine. Take for thy present need this purse of gold, [offers
			purse, Rodolphe by a gesture refuses it,] May [sic], when thou art rich thou
			can'st repay it. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Taking purse.] Nay, more, if what you say be true eternal gratitude-- </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> Bah, you trifle time, [waves his staff, panel opens,] yonder lies your path; it is a
			golden one, begone! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Farewell, come boy, come. [Music. Exit at panel, Greppo following turns to
			entreat Hertzog, who raises his staff threateningly; Greppo exits hurriedly at
			panel. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Hertzog</speaker>
		<p> [Stands in opening and chuckling gazes at them.] The thought of vegeance stirs
			within his heart, the lust of gold is rising in his soul, the path that leads to
			where 'tis hoarded ends in death. He's mine! Ha, ha, he's mine!] </p>

	<head>Scene II.--</head>
	<stage>A lobby in the castle of Wolfenstein, [in 1) Enter Barbara R. H. followed by
		Carline.</stage>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> Don't talk to me, girl, remember your station and consider mine. Who am I and what am
			I that I should be lodged in a wing of the castle, overlooking the dog kennels. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Carline</speaker>
		<p> Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your ladyship to calm
			yourself, it was out of consideration for your ladyship's eyes--any little
			flurry does so spoil the natural beauty of their expression. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> Carline, you're a good girl, you're a considerate girl, and I forgive you ; but eyes
			or no eyes. I'll not be imposed on. Where's Mynheer Von Puffengruntz? Where's his
			lordship's Chamberlain? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Carline</speaker>
		<p> [Looking L. H.] Here he comes down the great stairway, as full of flesh and scant of
			breath as ever [aside], and as the waddling old porpoise appears to have a
			liquorish tooth for this silly old buzzard, I leave them to bill and coo, while I
			run off to comfort dear 'Mina, who has passed the whole night in tears for poor
			Rodolphe.
			<stage> [Von Puff. enters L. H., CARLINE courteseys and exits L. H.]</stage>
			</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> Eh! what! madam Barbara, stirring so early? Why, bless my soul, the mist of the
			mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets of the castle. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> There let it hang, and be hanged to it! Stirring, indeed! Hav'nt I been stirring all
			night? Has'nt her ladyship been stirring all night, and wouldn't the Seven
			Sleepers have been stirring all night, too, if they had lodged where I did? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> Surely nothing has had the audacity to disturb the quiet of your slumbers? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> Nothing! To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of last night nothing? Why,
			the thunder creashed over the castle loud enough to wake the dead. That was bad
			enough, but only to think that I, the right honorable foster mother, that is to be,
			to her right honorable ladyship, that is to be, passing the night in apartments
			overlooking a dog-kennel. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> A dog-kennel! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> Aye, a kennel of great savage hounds, fed late at night with raw meat by their
			one-eyed keeper, on purpose to give them the night-mare, and make them dream all
			night long of chasing wild boars in the forest. Ugh! I shall never get their
			horrible yelping out of my head. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> Believe me, my dear madam Barbara, it is the first time the brutes ever were known to
			have been unruly. I promise you that they shall be soundly punished and instantly
			removed. But I, too, am criminal. The apartments were selected by me because they
			commanded the best view of the mountain. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> But I don't want to look at the mountain. I got a glimpse of it from one of the north
			windows last night during the storm, and it looked for all the world as if Belze-
			bub and his imps were holding a jubilee there. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> Enough, my dear madam Barbara, enough! If the mountain is unpleasant, it shall be
			removed. No, no, I--I mean you shall be removed. [Approaching her in a wheedling
			manner.] Will it please you to accompany me and choose for yourself. BLACK
			CROOK27 </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> [Simperingly] Really, mynheer Von Puffingruntz [sic], you have such molifying
			ways that--that-- </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> [Taking her hand.] Oh! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
		<p> Would it be prudent! Dare I trust myself? We poor silly things are so weak, and you
			men so naughty, that--that--[leans her head upon his shoulder, looks up into his
			face and sighs.] </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Puffengruntz</speaker>
		<p> Confiding innocence, rely upon the honor of a Von Puffengruntz. [Looks around,

			led off L. H. by Von Puffengruntz, chuckling.]</p>

staff. Greppo in improved condition.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> A strange, weird place, and one, it seems, not often trod by human footsteps. I

<sp>
<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
<p> Master Greppo! Master Greppo! He calls me master Greppo! Here's an honor, and
here's a master! Oh, such a master! Such a liberal master--as this stuffed
belly, tight as any drum with goodly provender and generous wine will
testify. <stage>[To Rodolphe]</stage> What think I, princely master? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Aye. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
<p> Why, since you honor me with consultation, and give me leave to think at all--a
privilege grown rusty from great lack of use--I say we're right, and that the
lake we seek is near at hand. </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
<p> Why think you so? </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
<p> Because just now I heard a bittern cry, and twice ere that I heard a marsh-frog
croak, and as they're both accounted water-fowl, 'twere safe to say that
we're near the water. </p>

	<head>SCENE IV.--The Grotto of Golden Stalactites.</head>
	<stage> A grand and comprehensive water-cavern of gold, deeply perspective, with
		stalacti-form arched roof. Cut wings representing vistas running parallel and
		harmonizing with that of the main grotto, the mouth of which [5 feet high and 5 feet
		wide] discloses an open lake or bath and distant shore at back. Set transparent silver
		waters, in which are seen sporting fishes and nondescript amphibea. Diminutive
		fairies asleep in the waters of the grotto in golden shells. Set ground or shore piece
		richly studded with gold and jewels. Set masses of emerald and gold R. L. and C. upon and
		at the foot of which are reclining gnomes and amphibea. Fairies asleep in poses R. and
		L. The moon --seen through opening at the back and over the distant shore of the
		lake--shows red at opening of scene. [Music at change. Shortly after which,
		Dragonfin, who has been asleep on a jewelled mass on the shore (C.), slowly awakens,
		rises, and stretches himself. Upon turning he sees the red upon the face of the moon.

		<p> [After song.] 'Tis she, our Queen. [All kneel.] [Music. Stalacta rises (C.) from

	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Arise, my loving subjects. [All rise.] </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Dragonfin</speaker>
		<p> Mistress, but now the light in yon great sapphire died out and stains of blood
			flushed in the face of the pale moon. You have scaped some deadly peril. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Thou art right. Listen, all. To-night, while wandering in the fastnesses of the
			Hartz, without my protecting talisman, I heedlessly trod within one of the
			charmed circles of our enemy, the arch-fiend Zamiel. Omnes. Ha! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> On the instant I was transformed into a white dove, with shorn pinions. From
			beneath the rank leaves of an adder-plant glided a huge serpent. Its eyes were
			burning coals, its tongue a living flame. I was paralyzed with fear and powerless
			to move. Nearer and nearer it came. I felt its stifling breath displace the purer
			air. I saw its venomed fangs glistening in the pale moonlight. Raising from out
			its deadly coil, it poised itself to strike, when suddenly a youth, a mortal,
			strangely present in that wild, wierd [sic.] spot, seeing the danger of the
			trembling bird, seized a dead bough, which chance had fashioned like a holy
			cross, and smote the foul thing dead, then bore me safely from the charmed spot and
			gave me life and liberty. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Dragonfin</speaker>
		<p> Revenge! Revenge on the minions of Zamiel. [Goes quickly off R. H. U. E.] Omnes.
			Revenge! Revenge! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Nay, let no thought other than of joy mingle with this happy time. Remember, 'tis my
			natal hour, and I would have it, as in the past, a festal one. Let the invisible
			Harmonies of this, our realm, breathe sweetest concord only; and you, bright
			Crystaline, with your four sisters, chase with flying feet the silver hours.
			[Seats herself on bank, C.] [Music. The fairies form for a dance. After the first
			pose, a loud, prolonged warning note, as if from a shell, is heard outside. at
			back. All start in alarm, and hold the attitude of listening. The sound is
			repeated. Music. Hurry. The pose is broken, and the faries[sic.], gnomes, and
			amphibea, seizing their arms, form an alarm on either side. Dragonfin appears
			quickly through trap behind 1st set water and lands in front of ground piece.]

		<p> The sentinel shells, played upon by the watchful winds, give alarm! Two daring
			mortals, armed with the enchanted magnet of the Black Crook, approach the secret
			entrance. Already they have passed the white whirlpool in
			safety. They come to despoil our realm of its glittering wealth.
			</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Fear not. The talisman they bear is powerless against the spells that guard the
			portal. Is my battalia at its post? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Dragonfin</speaker>
		<p> The invisible guards of the entrance are marshalled for their destruction, and
			their white bones shall glisten far down among the red branches of the blood
			coral. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> My faithful subjects, your Queen commends the zeal with which you would guard from
			mortal sight our beauteous realm ; but ere these rash intruders perish I would
			gratify a strange desire. Speed hence, good Dragonfin, catch me their shadows
			from the bosom of the moon-lighted lake, and cast them upon my faithful mirror. I
			would look upon them ere they fade forever. [Music. Dragonfin prostrates him-
			self before Stalacta, springs into the water and disappears.] </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Begin the spell. [Music. Chorus by fairies.] [Music. Dragonfin springs from the
			water, and, after prostrating himself before the Queen, rises and points to the
			water. Music. Fairies wave their wands. A small, arched-headed frame of gold and
			coral stalactites rises center at the distant entrance of the grotto, showing
			small figures of Rodolphe and Greppo in boat, the former at the prow, gazing
			anxiously forward ; the latter aft, in the attitude of paddling. </p>

		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> [Who has crossed down R. H. turns when the picture is fully shown. Chord.

			The mirror and figures quickly sink.] </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Dragonfin, come hither. Fly with swiftest speed to the rocks beneath the waters of
			the guarded entrance. When the frail bark which now approaches shall be rent
			asunder by the relentless spells that guard our realm, be it your task to snatch
			from death these daring mortals and bear them safely hither. </p>

		 <p>Nay, question me not, away, away. Slaves of my power,

		<stage>[Music. Hurry. Dragonfire[sic] bows low, springs into the water and
			disappears. Music. A small boat with two mechanical figures, representing
			Rodolphe and Greppo as they appeared in the mirror, appears from R. H. outside, at
			the distant entrance of the grotto, and moves very slowly across; when it reaches
			the center of the open- i it sinks at the sound of gong and flash of lightning at
			back. Music. Hurry. All the gnomes, amphibia[sic.], etc., utter exclamations
			of delight and indulge in extravagant antics, until checked by a gesture from
			Stalacta. Soft music. Dragonfin rises slowly from the water (C.), supporting on
			either side Rodolphe and Greppo, the latter gasping violently for breath as his
			head appears. They step on shore, Rodolphe &amp; Greppo lost in bewilderment.
			Dragonfin bows low before Stalacta. The other amphibia[sic.] and gnomes made a
			demonstration of attack.]</stage>

		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Rubbing his eyes.] Is this a phantasm--this glittering gold, yon flashing gems,
			these strange, fantastic shapes? Have I, then, passed the portal of an unknown
			world, or am I dreaming? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Welcome, brave mortal, to our bright domain, and you my subjects, know and greet
			your Queen's preserver. [Music. Gnomes and amphibia[sic.] cluster around
			Rodolphe and Greppo, rolling at their feet and indulging in various grateful
			antics, after which the fairies surround them and evince their delight.] </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> [Still bewildered.] If this, indeed, be not a dream, tell me, bright being, you
			whose simple motion seems to sway the moods and passions of this elfin band, who
			art thou, and where am I? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> I am called Stalacta, Queen of this dazzling realm. The glittering wonders that

		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Who is thy droll companion? </p>

		<p> You speak of service done ; have we, then, met before? </p>

	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Yes, once. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Indeed! When? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> This very night. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> To-night? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> To-night, in the Glen of Firs ; but not as now. Then a poor, weak, fluttering,
			charm-encompassed bird, you snatched me trembling from the jaws of death, broke
			the dark spell of transformation, and gave to me the priceless boon of liberty.
			</p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> I do remember-- </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Greppo</speaker>
		<p> And so do I. Phew! how the sparks flew when master smashed the head of the scaly
			monster, and such a smell of brimstone! I do believe it was one of Belzebub's own
			imps in disguise. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Again thou art welcome. This is my natal hour-- wilt view the sports of this our
			carnival? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Most willingly. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> And while the revels proceed thou shalt tell me thy story. </p>
	</sp>
	<stage> [Music. Seats are brought forward by amphibia[sic.] R. H. 1st ent.; Stalacta and
		Rodolphe sit; Greppo disposes himself L. H. 1st ent., amusing himself with
		Dragonfin, gnomes and amphibia, who present him from time to time with nuggets of gold
		and jewels, which he thrusts into his pockets until they become greatly distended,
		during which action the diminutive sprites reappear in shells on water, floating to
		and fro, fishing. The fairies form for dance as at first. Grand ballet action by
		principals and full corps de ballet, during which the fishers in the shells are seen to
		catch small silver fish.</stage>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> [Rising and leading Rodolphe forward] Thy story claims for thee my pity and my aid.

	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> And Hertzog, the Black Crook-- </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Is a vile sorcerer, whose dark, unhallowed spells were wrought for thy
			destruction. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> How? </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Beneath the entrance to this charmed spot lie intertwined amid the branches of the
			coraline whole hecatombs of human bones, the whitened relics of adventurous
			mortals who, like thyself, have sought this realm. Until to night, no human eye
			has ever seen the dazzling splendor of this wondrous dome ; no human footsteps
			save thine own and his who follows thee have ever pressed these sands of gold. Had
			not thy coming been to me foreshadowed, and all my power been interposed to snatch
			thee from the impending doom, thou, too, hadst joined the hapless band that
			mouldering lies beneath yon depths. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Then is thy debt to me already paid. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> Not so. I am still thy debtor, and must ever be. Thou art environed by danger, and
			need the power of my protection. Return unto the outer world again ; thy happi-
			ness is there. She whom thou lovest is worthy of thy love ; therefore return. </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Rodolphe</speaker>
		<p> Amina, dear Amina! </p>
	</sp>
	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> In the secret cells of these caverns, whose walls are solid gold, lie counteless
			hoards of richest treasure, gleaned for ages by the tireless gnomes. In the
			crystal depths of these waters sparkle gems richer by far than human eyes have
			ever gazed upon ; of these thou shalt bear with thee the choicest. Behold my gift!
			<stage> [A golden boat, studded with jewels, glides on from L. H. to L. C.]
				</stage> This bark, protected by a potent spell, loaded with rich and costly
			jewels, shall bear thee safely to yon neighboring shore. My faithful gnomes
			shall be thy treasure bearers. But ere we part take thou this jewelled circlet.
			<stage> [Gives him a ring from her finger.]</stage> Should danger threaten, as
			perchance it will, for baffled mal- i has a thousand stings, press but thy lips
			upon the gem and thou wilt find me by thy side.

	<sp>
		<speaker>Stalacta</speaker>
		<p> [Raising him.] Farewell!</p>
	</sp>
	<stage> [Music. He steps into the boat ; Greppo, bearing a large mass of gold,
		affectionately embraces Dragonfin, shakes hands with the gnomes and
		amphibia[sic.], kisses the fairies, bows low to Stalacta and gets into the boat. A
		dolphin glittering in green and gold rises from behind 2d or 3d set water, with
		principal danseuse bearing vase of treasure ; other dolphins float on R. &amp; L.,
		with diminutive sprites bearing treasure. Copious shower of gold, the other sprites
		on the water catching the flakes in silver shells. Poses by gnomes, amphibia[sic.]

		<sp>
			<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
			<p> [Unmasking and coming forward.] Phew! what a relief. Thank the saints his
				Countship's birthday comes but once a year. Another such festival would be
				the death of me. I'm stewed, fried, boiled and roasted. [Fans herself
				vigorously. Enter from terrace, L. H. Von Puffengruntz. Puffengruntz [At

			<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
			<p> [R. H. casting sidelong glances at him.] Heigho! There he is! My charms

				musn't draw him in too suddenly. These men are like trout--they must be
				played with a little. Puffengruntz Full moon of the festival, why have you so
				cruelly robbed the grand hall of your light, and left us to grope about in the
				dull glimmer of the sickly stars. BLACK CROOK 35 </p>

		<sp>
			<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
			<p> Deceiver! Did'nt I see you gallivanting with the fraulein Von

				Politeness, my dear madam Barbara, mere politeness on my honor. The fact
				is, I-I had the misfortune to tread on the lady's favorite bunion, and what

		</sp>
		<sp>
			<speaker>Barbara</speaker>
			<p> Oh, you men, you deceiving men, you are always ready with an excuse.
				Puffengruntz On the honor of a Von Puffengruntz, I swear I speak the truth!
				The fraulein Von Skragneck, indeed. Haven't I got eyes? Ah, cruel fair one,

			<p> It's coming at last, I know it's coming. [pressing her heart,] what a strange
				flutter ; I hope I'm not going to faint ; dear me, what poor, weak, silly

				it is that I happen to have my smelling salts about me, [draws flask from her
				pocket, turns her back to Von Puff. and drinks.] Puffengruntz She's moved,

				disturbed.] Foiled, tricked, crossed in the hour of my victory! A life,

		<p> Cackle, my dear. You know I never have a moment's peace. You're not even quiet when
			you're asleep; you snore, Madam Van Puffengrunz; you snore loud enough to split
			the drum of my ear and rip up the seam up my night-cap. </p>

<head> SCENE II.--</head> <stage> The retreat of Rodolphe in the Forest of Bo-
  hemia (in 2.)  [Music.]  Distant sound of hunter's 
  horn and echo.  Enter, L. H. U. E., Rodolphe and 
  Amina, followed by Greppo.  The two first are in hunting 
  costume.</stage> 
<sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>  [Throwing his spear and horn to Greppo.]  I weary 
with the chase.  Call together our people and bid them lead 
our horses to where the forest path crosses the brook.  There 
we will join them.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Greppo</speaker> <p>  'Tis wisely resolved, good master.  The sun de-
clines, and night comes on apace, and we are yet some three 
good miles from home; besides, I'm hollow as a drum.  
Moreover, in early autumn venison keeps not overlong, and 
the fat haunch of yonder noble stag cries out for speedy 
roasting.  Pray do not tarry long. [Exit L. H. 2d ent.]  
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>  Well, dear love, to-morrow ends the year of our pro-
bation.  To-morrow, at the holy altar's foot, I call you mine.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Amina</speaker> <p>  To-morrow!  How brief the time, and yet how long 
till then!  Oh, Rodolphe, will it come to us?  There seems 
to be a lurking danger in the air--a cloud between us and 
the coming light.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>  Fear not.  Here, in the deep seculsion of our forest 
home, we are safe from all pursuit.  [Distant horn and echo 
L. H. at back.]  Hark ! 'tis Greppo calling in the huntsmen.  
Let's on to meet him. </p> </sp>

Fly, Amina! seek safety with our people.  My arm shall 
bar pursuit!

  Wol. Alive!  Take him alive!  Yield!
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>  [Standing on his defense.]  He who takes my sword 
must win it.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Hertzog</speaker> <p>  Put up thy blade.  She whom thou wouldst invoke 
is powerless to aid.
  </p> </sp> <sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>   False wretch!  But that another life hangs on the 
slender thread of mine, though coward numbers swarmed 
on every side, I'd try this issue with my single sword!  
But know thou still art juggled with.  The poower I once 
invoked is potent still. </p> </sp> <stage>  [Music.  He kisses the ring.  Sta-
lacta springs from the thicket, L. H. flat, in glittering full 
armor, Dragonfin on from L. H. 2d ent.]</stage> 
  <sp> <speaker>Rodolphe</speaker> <p>  Behold! we meet on equal ground!
  Wol. Though environed by a thousand fiends, my hate 
would find a way to reach you.</p> </sp> 
  <stage> [Music.  Grand triple sword combat.  Rodolphe and 
   Wolfenstein, Stalacta and Hertzog, Dragonfin and Wulf-
   gar.  Wolfenstein and Wulfgar are slain.  Hertzog, 
   wounded and dismayed, flies, R. H. 2d ent.  Amina, 
   who during the combat has knelt in prayer, throws her-
   self into the arms of Rodolphe ; then both kneel at the   
   feet of Stalacta.  Dragonfin indulges in grotesque exul-
   tation over the bodies of Wolfenstein and Wulfgar.

		<p> What's the use? Now what is the use? The oftener I call the fainter comes the answer.
			Here it is quite dark. Master waiting for the horses and I wandering about like a

			beg his infernal majesty's pardon. I hope I have not said anything to offend; but
			strange sights and sounds are in the air. Birds that ought to have been to roost an
			hour ago, fly screaming from tree to tree. The dismal screech-owl, from its hole
			in the oak, answers the croak of the dreary monk-raven ; and just now I saw a big fat
			buck scampering through the forrest[sic.] with his tail on fire. Oh dear! Oh
			dear! what fearful omens! And I'm to be married to-morrow. If anything should
			happen to me! If my poor, dear, darling little Carline should happen to be left a
			widow before she's made a wife-- if I should never taste--that is, if I should
			never know--Oh, Lord ! it won't bear thinking of. I'll try once more. [Minds the
